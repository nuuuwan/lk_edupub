Foreword

The educational objectives of the contemporary world are becoming more complex along

with the economic, social, cultural and technological development. The learning and teaching

process too is changing in relation to human experiences, technological differences, research

and new indices. Therefore, it is required to produce the textbook by including subject related

information according to the objectives in the syllabus in order to maintain the teaching

process by organizing learning experiences that suit to the learner needs. The textbook is not

merely a learning tool for the learner. It is a blessing that contributes to obtain a higher

education along with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop values and to obtain

learning experiences.

The government in its realization of the concept of free education has offered you all the

textbooks from grades 1-11. I would like to remind you that you should make the maximum

use of these textbooks and protect them well. I sincerely hope that this textbook would assist

you to obtain the expertise to become a virtuous citizen with a complete personality who

would be a valuable asset to the country.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial and writer boards as

well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department who have strived to offer this

textbook to you.

Inequalities21

By studying this lesson you will be able to;

²² solve inequalities of the form x + a b,²² solve inequalities of the form ax b,²² find the integral solutions of an inequality,²² represent the solutions of an inequality on a number line.

In Sri Lanka, a person who is 55 years or older is considered to be a senior citizen. Accordingly, if we denote the age of a senior citizen by t, then we can indicate this by the inequality t 55. This means that the value of t is always greater or equal to 55.

Let us recall what was learnt in grade 8 regarding inequalities.

x > 3 is an inequality. This means that the values that x can take are the values that are greater than 3. However, if we write x 3 , this means that the values that x can take are 3 or a value greater than 3.

Similarly, x < 3 means that the values that x can take are the values that are less than 3, and x 3 means that the values that x can take are 3 or a value less than 3.

For example, the solution set of x > 3 is the set of all numbers which are greater than 3. The set of integral solutions of this inequality is {4, 5, 6, 7, …}.

The three dots mean that all the integers which belong to the pattern indicated by the first few values belong to the solution set. Therefore, the above inequality has infinitely many integral solutions.

Although in mathematics it is important to represent all the solutions as a set, when indicating the integral solutions of an inequality, it is sufficient to just write the values. For example, the integral solutions of the inequality x > 3 can be written as 4, 5, 6, … .

2For free distribution.

The solution set of an inequality which has an algebraic term, is the set of all values that the algebraic term can take. Let us recall what has been learnt earlier regarding the solution set of an inequality, and how this is represented on a number line, by considering the following examples.

Example 1 Consider the inequality x > 3.

Review Exercise

21.1 Inequalities of the form x + a b

The following notice has been placed near a certain bridge.

—This bridge can only bear loads of less than 10 tons˜

Suppose a lorry of mass 4 tons carrying a certain load wishes to cross this bridge. If we take the mass of the load carried by the lorry to be x tons, then the lorry can safely cross the bridge only if x + 4 < 10. In other words, if the mass of the load carried by the lorry is x tons, then the lorry can safely cross the bridge, only if the inequality x + 4 < 10 is satisfied.

We can find the mass of the load that the lorry can safely carry across the bridge by solving the inequality x + 4 < 10.

Solving an inequality means, obtaining an inequality equivalent to the given inequality such that only x (or the given variable) is on one side of the inequality.

When solving an inequality, we can adopt the procedure followed in solving equations to a large extent.

For example, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the above inequality x + 4 < 10.Accordingly,x + 4 – 4 < 10 – 4. When we simplify this we obtainx < 6.

4For free distribution.

Therefore, for the lorry to safely cross the bridge, the load that it carries should be less than 6 tons.

Example 1 Solve the inequality x + 2 < 7 and represent the integral solutions on a number line. x + 2 < 7 x + 2 – 2 < 7 – 2 (subtracting 2 from both sides) x < 5 The integral solutions of this inequality are the integers that are less than 5. That is, the values 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, –1, –2, … .

These integral solutions can also be expressed as a set as {4, 3, 2, 1, 0, – 1, – 2, …}The solution set can be represented on a number line as follows.

Integral solutions of x

–134567012

All the solutions (numbers that are greater or equal to 4) are represented here. It is important to remember that not only the integral solutions, but solutions such as 4.5 and 5.02 are also included.

Example 3 The maximum mass that a bag can carry is 6 kg. Nimal puts x packets of rice of mass 1 kilogramme each and 2 packets of sugar of mass 1 kilogramme each into this bag. This information can be represented by the inequality x + 2 6.

5For free distribution.

i. Solve this inequality.ii. What is the maximum number of packets of rice that Nimal can carry in this bag?

i. x + 2 6 x + 2 – 2 6 – 2

this bag is 4.

Exercise 21.1

1. Solve each of the following inequalities and write the set of integral solutions.

i. x + 3 > 5 ii. x – 4 < 1 iii. x – 7 – 6 iv. 2 + x – 4 v. 7 + x > 5

2. Solve each of the following inequalities and represent the solution set on a

number line.

i. x + 1 > 3 ii. x – 3 1 iii. 6 + x 2 iv. x – 7 < – 7 v. x + 5 > – 1

3. Sakindu has 60 rupees. He buys a book for x rupees and a pen for 10 rupees.

The total value of the items he bought can be expressed in terms of an inequality as x + 10 60. Solve this inequality and determine the maximum price that the book could be.

4.The maximum number of people that can travel in a certain van is 15. If 3

people get into the van from one location and x number of people from another location, this information can be represented by the inequality x + 3 15.

i. Solve the above inequality. ii. What is the maximum number of people that can get into the van from the

second location?

5. The sum of the ages of Githmi and Nethmi does not exceed 30. Githmi is 14

years old. If Nethmi’s age is taken as x years, this information can be represented by the inequality x + 14 30. Solve this inequality and find the maximum age that Nethmi could be.

6For free distribution.

21.2 Inequalities of the form ax b

The price of two books of the same type is more than 40 rupees. If we take the price of one of these books as x rupees, we can represent this information by the inequality 2x > 40 involving x. By solving this inequality, we can find the price that each book could be.

When solving this type of inequalities there are some important facts that we should keep in mind.

Consider the following inequalities.

i. The inequality 3 < 4 is true. 2 3 < 2 4 (multiplying both sides by 2) The inequality 6 < 8 is true.

ii. The inequality 8 > 6 is true.

8

2 > 6

2 (dividing both sides by 2)

The inequality 4 > 3 is true.

When the two sides of an inequality are either multiplied by the same positive number or divided by the same positive number, the inequality sign does not change.

iii. The inequality 2 < 3 is true. 2 – 2 < 3 – 2 (multiplying both sides by – 2)

The inequality – 4 < – 6 which is obtained is false. However, – 4 > – 6 is true.

iv. The inequality 9 > 6 is true.

9– 3 > 6

– 3 (dividing both sides by – 3)

The inequality – 3 > – 2 which is obtained is false. However, – 2 < – 3 is true.

When an inequality is multiplied or divided by a negative number, the inequality sign changes. That is, the sign < changes to > and the sign changes to , etc . Through the following examples, let us learn how inequalities are solved taking into consideration the above facts.

Sets22 By studying this lesson you will be able to;• identify finite and infinite sets,• write the subsets of a given set,• identify equivalent sets, equal sets, disjoint sets and universal sets,• identify the intersection and union of two sets,• identify the complement of a set,• represent sets using Venn diagrams.

Introduction to sets You have learnt earlier that a set is a collection of items that can be clearly identified. The items in a set are called its elements. Curly brackets are used to represent sets in terms of their elements. If a is an element of the set A, we denote this by a A. Moreover, the number of elements in the set A is denoted by n(A).

Let us recall what was learnt previously about the different ways in which a set can be expressed.

1. Describing the set using a common characteristic by which the elements can be

clearly identified 2. Writing the elements within curly brackets 3. Using a Venn diagram

As an example, let us consider how to write the set of all even numbers between 0 and 10 using the above 3 methods in the given order. Let us name this set A.

1. A = {even numbers between 0 and 10} 2. A = {2, 4, 6, 8}

3. A

4286

The set which has no elements is known as the null set. The null set is denoted by { } and also by O. The number of elements in the null set is 0. Therefore, n(O) = 0.

11For free distribution.

Example 1 If P = {even prime numbers between 5 and 10}, then find n(P).Since there are no even prime numbers between 5 and 10, P = O and therefore n(P) = 0.

Review Exercise

1. Determine whether each of the following collections is a set.

i. Multiples of four between 0 and 30

ii. The districts of Sri Lanka

iii. Students who are good at mathematics

iv. Triangular numbers

v. The 10 largest integers

2. Write each set given below in terms of its elements and write the number of

elements in each set too.

i. A = {multiples of 5 between 0 and 20};

ii. B = {letters of the word “RECONCILLIATION”}

iii. C = {prime numbers between 2 and 13}

iv. D = {numbers between 0 and 20 which are a product of two prime numbers}

3. D = {whole numbers between 5 and 10}.

i. Write the elements of D.

ii. Find n(D).

4. Express the null set in three different ways using the above mentioned first

method (That is, by the descriptive method using a special characteristic.)

12For free distribution.

22.1 Finite sets, infinite sets, equivalent sets and equal sets

Finite sets and infinite setsTwo sets which have been expressed in terms of a common characteristic by which the elements of the set can be clearly identified, are given below.

A = {multiples of 3 between 0 and 20} B = {multiples of 5}

Let us write the elements of each set within curly brackets.

A = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18} B = {5, 10, 15, 20, ...}

The number of elements in set A is 6. That is, the number of elements in this set is a specific number. Sets with a specific number of elements (that is, sets with a finite number of elements), are known as finite sets.

The number of elements in set B however, cannot be stated definitely. That is, the number of elements in this set is infinite. Three dots have been placed at the end of the list of numbers within curly brackets to denote that the set B has an infinite number of elements. Sets that have an infinite number of elements are known as infinite sets.

Example 1 For each of the sets given below, write the elements and write whether it is a finite set or an infinite set.

P = {positive multiples of 6 less than 30}Q = {polygons}

P = {6, 12, 18, 24} n(P) = 4Q = {triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon, … }

Since the number of elements in the set P is finite, P is a finite set. Since the number of elements in the set Q is infinite, Q is an infinite set.

Equal setsConsider the two sets given below.

A = {even numbers between 0 and 10}

B = {digits of the number 48268}

13For free distribution.

These two sets can be written as follows in terms of their elements.

A = {2, 4, 6, 8}B = {2, 4, 6, 8}

Although the two sets A and B have been described differently, when they are written in terms of their elements, we get the same set. Sets which have the same elements are known as equal sets. Accordingly, A and B are equal sets. If two sets A and B are equal then we write A = B.

Equivalent setsIf the number of elements in the two sets A and B are equal, that is, if n(A) = n(B), then the sets A and B are known as equivalent sets.

If A and B are equivalent sets, we denote this by A~B.

Example 2 X = {odd numbers between 0 and 10}Y = {vowels in the English alphabet}

By writing the elements of these sets, show that they are equivalent sets.

x = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} n(X) = 5 y = {a, e, i, o, u} n(Y) = 5

Since n(X) = n(Y), X and Y sets are equivalent sets.

Note :- Although all pairs of equal sets are equivalent, all pairs of equivalent sets

need not be equal.

Exercise 22.11. From the sets given below, select and write the finite sets and the infinite sets

separately.

i. A = {multiples of 5 from 0 to 50} ii. B = {integers}iii. C ={numbers that can be written using only the digits 0 and 1}iv. D = {digits of the number 25265}

v. E = {positive integers which are not prime}

14For free distribution.

2. Write each of the following sets in terms of their elements and then write all pairs of equal sets and all pairs of equivalent sets.

P = {positive multiples of 3 below 10}

Q = {letters of the word “net”}

R = {odd numbers between 0 and 10}

S = {digits of the number 3693}T = {vowels in the English alphabet}

v = {letters of the word “ten”}

3. Write 3 examples of finite sets.

4. Write 3 examples of infinite sets.

5. Write three sets which are equivalent to the set {2, 3}.

22.2 The universal set and subsets

SubsetsWhen two sets A and B are considered, if all the elements in set B are also in set A, then set B is known as a subset of set A.

As an example, let us consider the two sets given below which are expressed in terms of their elements.

A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

B = {2, 4, 6}

Since all the elements in set B are in set A, set B is a subset of set A. This is denoted by B

∩

A or A

∩

B, and is read as " B is a subset of A".

Now let us consider another set C. If C = {1, 2, 7}, then not every element in C belongs to A. Therefore C is not a subset of A. This is denoted by C

∩

A.

Example 1 P = {multiples of 6 between 0 and 20}Q = {multiples of 3 between 0 and 20}

Write the elements of each of the above sets and select the subset.P = {6, 12, 18}

15For free distribution.

Q = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18}As all the elements of P are in Q, P is a subset of Q.

Example 2 Write all the subsets of the set X = {1, 2}.

It is evident that {1} and {2} are two subsets. Observe that {1, 2} is also a subset. In fact, if two sets A and B are equal, then A is a subset of B and B is a subset of A. Furthermore, the null set is considered to be a subset of every set.

Since the null set and the set itself are subsets of the given set, { } and {1, 2} are subsets of the above set X.

Accordingly, the above set X has 4 subsets which are { },{1},{2},{1, 2}.

Example 3 Write all the subsets of the set Y = {3, 5, 7}.

{ }, {3}, {5}, {7}, {3, 5}, {3, 7}, {5, 7}, {3, 5, 7} There are 8 subsets.

Universal sets

In a study conducted on the students of your school, several subsets may come under consideration.

The following can be given as examples.

{Students in grade 9}{Female students}{Students sitting for the G.C.E (O/L) examination this year}

The elements of all the above sets are contained in the set of all students of the school. This set can be considered as the universal set relevant to the above study.

Let us consider another example.

When we consider the sets of even numbers, odd numbers, triangular numbers and prime numbers, we see that they are all subsets of the set of integers. Therefore the set of integers can be considered as the universal set.

A universal set is a set which contains all the elements under consideration. Universal sets are denoted by ε.

As another example, suppose that the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are written on the 6 sides of a cubic die. By rolling this die once, the score that can be obtained is one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.Therefore, we obtain {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} as the set of possible outcomes. This is the universal set of all possible outcomes that can be obtained when a die is rolled once.This can be expressed as ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. A few subsets of this universal set are given below. A = {odd numbers} A = {1, 3, 5} B = {values greater than 4} B = {5, 6} C = {even prime numbers} C = {2}

22.4 Intersection of sets, union of sets and disjoint sets

Intersection of setsWhen two or more sets are considered, the set consisting of the elements which are common to all the sets is known as their intersection. When two sets A and B are considered, their intersection is denoted by A∩B.

As an example, let us consider the pair of sets given below,A ={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} B ={2, 5, 6, 7} The set consisting of the elements common to both A and B is {2, 5, 7}.

Therefore, the intersection of the sets A and B is A∩B = {2, 5, 7}.

Example 1 M = {students of KannangaraVidyalaya who play cricket}N = {students of KannagaraVidyalaya who play football}Write the set M∩N in descriptive form.

M∩N = {students of KannangaraVidyalaya who play both cricket and football}

19For free distribution.

Now let us consider how the intersection of two sets is represented in a Venn diagram.Suppose the two sets A and B have common elements. That is, A and B have a non - empty intersection. There should be a region to represent the set of elements common to both these sets. The Venn diagram depicting this is given below.

ε

A

The shaded region in the figure is common to both the sets A and B. Therefore the elements that are common to these two sets can be included here.

Let us consider how to represent two sets with a non-empty intersection in a Venn diagram, through the following example.

Example 2 Write the following two sets by listing their elements and then find their intersection. Represent all the elements in a Venn diagram.

P ={prime numbers between 0 and 10} Q ={odd numbers between 0 and 15}P ={2, 3, 5, 7} Q ={1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13} ∴ P∩Q = {3, 5, 7}

Let us consider how two sets which do not have common elements represented in a Venn diagram.

Disjoint sets

If two sets have no elements in common, then they are known as disjoint sets. In other words, if two sets A and B are such that A∩B = O, then A and B are disjoint sets. Disjoint sets can be represented in a Venn diagram as shown below.

B

ε

As an example, let us consider the two sets shown below.A ={2, 4, 6, 8} B ={1, 3, 5, 7} Since A∩B = O, A and B are disjoint sets.

Union of setsWhen two or more sets are considered, the set which consists of all the elements in these sets is known as the union of these sets. When two sets A and B are considered, their union is denoted by A

∩

B.

As an example, let us consider the pair of sets given below.

A ={1, 3, 5, 7, 8}B ={2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}

The union of the sets A and B is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.

Accordingly, the union of the sets A and B is A

B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

22.5 Complement of a set

Let us consider a subset A of a universal set. The set of elements in the universal set which do not belong to the set A is known as the complement of A.

Consider the following example.

24For free distribution.

If we take,ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and A = {2, 4, 6},then the set consisting of all the elements in the universal set which are not in set A is {1, 3, 5, 7}.

This set is the complement of the set A. The complement of the set A is denoted by A'. Accordingly,we can write, A' = {1, 3, 5, 7}.

Example 1

By considering the given universal set (ε) and its subset B, write the set B' in terms of its elements. ε ={5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35} B ={10, 20, 30 }

B = {5, 15, 25, 35}

Example 2

If ε = {birds}andP = {birds that make nests}, then write P in descriptive form. P ={birds that do not make nests}

Now let us see how to represent the complement of a set in a Venn diagram.

If A is a subset of a universal set, then A' is represented in a Venn diagram as follows.

A is the set of elements which belong to ε but not to A. Therefore the whole region in the Venn diagram which does not belong to A, belongs to A .

Q

Suppose AB is considered as the base of the parallelogram. AB and DC (the side opposite AB) are parallel to each other. According to the figure, the perpendicular distance between these two sides is XY. Therefore, XY is the perpendicular height corresponding to the base AB. When BC is considered as the base, the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides BC and AD according to the figure is PQ. Therefore, PQ is the perpendicular height corresponding to the base BC.

Observe that h is the perpendicular height corresponding to the base AB.

According to these facts, a formula for the area of a parallelogram can be given as below.

23.3 The area of a circle

We have learnt how to find the area of a lamina that takes the shape of a rectangle, a square, a triangle, a parallelogram or a trapezium. Now let us consider how the area of a circular shaped lamina can be found.

To do this, let us first engage in the activity given below.

Activity 2

Step 1 : Draw a circle of radius 6 cm on a sheet of paper.

Step 2 : Divide the circle into the maximum possible number of sectors (about

Since paper is not wasted, the areas of the circle and the rectangle should be equal. Find the area of the rectangle as shown below by considering the radius of the circle as r.The length of the rectangle that is obtained = circumference of the circle × 1

2

= 2πr × 1

2 = πr The width of the rectangle that is obtained = r

The area of the rectangle = length × width = πr × r = πr2

∴ Therefore, the area of a circle of radius r = πr2

In calculations, we use 3.142 or 22

7 for the value of π.

Example 1 Find the area of a circular lamina of radius 14 cm.

14 cm

The area of the circular lamina = πr2

= 22

7 × 14 × 14

1 = 616

∴ Therefore, the area of the circular lamina is 616 cm2.

Example 2 Calculate the radius of a circular lamina of area 154 cm2.

The area of the circular lamina = πr2

The area of the circular lamina is given as 154 cm2.

Therefore, 22

22r2

22 = 1078

22 = 49

r2 = 49 Therefore, r = 7 or r = − 7.

However, the radius cannot be a negative value.Therefore, the radius of the circle is 7 cm.

Probability24

By studying this lesson you will be able to;

• identify random experiments,• write the sample space of a random experiment,• identify the equally likely outcomes of a random experiment,• find the probability of an event in a sample space when the outcomes are equally likely.

24.1 Random experiment

Let us consider the experiment of an ordinary coin being tossed. When a coin is tossed, we know that the outcome will be either “head turns up” or “tail turns up”. That is, we know all the possible outcomes before the experiment is conducted. However, we cannot say with certainly whether head will turn up or tail will turn up. Furthermore, this experiment can be repeated any number of times under the same conditions. Another feature is that we will not be able to identify a pattern in the outcomes when the experiment is repeated. Experiments with the above features are called random experiments.

Random experiments have the following common characteristics.

• The experiment can be repeated any number of times under the same conditions.• All the possible outcomes of the experiment are known before the experiment is

carried out.• The outcome of the experiment cannot be stated with certainty before the

experiment is carried out. • When the experiment is repeated, a pattern cannot be recognized in the outcomes.

Let us consider another example.

Even though all the outcomes of the experiment of rolling an unbiased cubic die with its faces numbered from 1 to 6 and recording the number on the face that turns up are known, it is not possible before carrying out the experiment to state with certainty which outcome will occur. Moreover, this experiment can be repeated any number of times under the same conditions, but a pattern in the outcomes cannot be expected. Therefore, rolling an unbiased cubic die and observing the outcome is a random experiment.

numbered from 1 to 4, and recording the number on the face which touches the table.

2. Drawing a bead from a bag which contains beads of

one color and recording its colour.

3. Throwing a ball at a target and observing whether it

5. Checking whether a door opens when a key picked

falls to the ground.

7. Drawing out two cards from a box containing three

cards, each with one of the numbers 1, 3 and 5 written on it, and observing whether the sum of the two numbers on the two cards that are drawn is an odd number.

24.2 Sample Space

All the possible outcomes of a random experiment can be written as a set. This set which consists of all the possible outcomes of a random experiment is called its sample space. It is usually denoted by S.

For example,

in the experiment of tossing a coin and observing the side that turns up, the set of all possible outcomes, that is, the sample space is S = {Head, Tail}. Here N (S) = 2.

Similarly, the sample space of the experiment of observing the number which turns up when an unbiased cubic die with its faces numbered from 1 to 6 is rolled is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} Here N (S) = 6.

44For free distribution.

Example 1 Write the sample space for the experiment of rolling an unbiased tetrahedral die with its faces numbered from 1 to 4 and recording the number on the face which touches the table. S = ™1, 2, 3, 4š n(S) = 4Example 2 Write the sample space for the experiment of drawing a bead from a bag which contains two black beads and three white beads marked B1, B2, W1, W2, W3 respectively, which are identical in all other aspects. What is the value of n(S)? S = ™ B1, B2, W1, W2, W3 š n(S) = 5

Example 3 There are two cards such that R is written on one side and Y is written on the other side. The cards are tossed simultaniously and the letters turned up is recorded. Write the sample space of this experiment.

Getting R on both cards is denoted by (R, R) and getting R on one card and Y on the other is denoted as (R, Y) etc.. Accordingly,

S = ™(RR), (RY), (YR), (YY)š

Note: An event is a subset of the sample space of a random experiment.

Exercise 24.21. Write the sample space of each of the following experiments.

i. Randomly drawing a pen from a bag which contains one pen each of the colors blue, red, black and green and recording the colour. (Assume that the pens are identical in all aspects except the colour)

iv. A bag contains 4 milk flavoured toffees and 3 orange flavoured toffees of the

same size and shape. Randomly drawing a toffee and recording its flavour.

v. Recording the sides that turn up when a coin is tossed twice.

24.3 Equally likely outcomes

When the sample space of a random experiment is considered, if each outcome is equally likely to occur, then that experiment is called an experiment with equally likely outcomes. The outcomes of such an experiment are called equally likely outcomes.

Let us consider a cubic die with its faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Let us assume that the material it is made of is uniformly distributed throughout the die. Then it is clear that due to symmetry, each face of the die has an equal chance of turning up when the die is rolled. Similarly for a coin. Objects such as these which are symmetrical and are made of a material which is uniformly distributed are called unbiased or fair objects. Experiments such as these, of tossing a fair coin or rolling an unbiased die are considered as important examples when it comes to explaining the theory of probability.

Consider the experiment of rolling a cuboidal die with its faces marked, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and recording the number on the face that turns up. Here, the likelihood of the different sides turning up may not be the same. Therefore such a die is not considered to be a fair die. In such experiments, the outcomes are not equally likely. Now let us consider another experiment.

It is clear that in the experiment of an unbiased cubic die with four faces painted red and two faces painted blue being rolled and the colour of the face that turns up being recorded, the chance of a red face turning up is greater than a blue face turning up. Therefore, the outcomes of this experiments are not equally likely.

Exercise 24.31. For each of the following experiments, determine whether the outcomes are

equally likely or not.

i. The four faces of an unbiased tetrahedral die are painted in four different

colours, namely, red, blue, yellow and green. Recording the colour of the face which turns up when it is rolled.

ii. Recording the side which turns up when a fair coin is tossed.

24.4 Probability of an event when the outcomes are equally likely

You have learnt that the probability of an outcome of a random experiment with equally likely outcomes is given by the following.

outcomes of this experiment are equally likely, the probability of getting an even number is 3

6 .

The probability of an event in the sample space of a random experiment with equally likely outcomes is given by the following.

Probability of the event

=

Number of elements in the event

Number of elements in the sample space

This can be written using symbols as follows.

If the number of elements in the sample space S is n (S), the number of elements in the event A is n(A) and the probability of event A occurring is p(A), then

p (A) =

n (A)

Angles of a Polygon25

By studying this lesson you will be able to; ² solve geometrical problems related to the interior angles of a polygon, ² solve geometrical problems related to the exterior angles of a polygon, ² solve problems related to regular polygons.

A plane figure bounded by three or more straight line segments is known as a polygon. The two main types of polygons are convex polygons and concave polygons.

Convex PolygonsConcave Polygons

Some polygons have special names by which they are identified, which depend on the number of sides they have. Accordingly, polygons which have 3, 4, 5 and 6 sides respectively are known as triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons and hexagons.

In previous grades you have learnt the following results on the sum of the interior angles of a triangle and of a quadrilateral.

The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180

In the given figure, O is any point within the quadrilateral PQRS. By joining PO, QO, RO and SO we obtain 4 triangles.

Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180

o,

considering the triangle PQO we obtain, p + q + a = 180

o,

considering the triangle QRO we obtain, r + s + b = 180

o,

considering the triangle RSO we obtain, t + u + c = 180

o,

considering the triangle SPO we obtain, v + w + d = 180

o,

By adding these 4 equations we obtain,

(p + q + a) + (r + s + b) + (t + u + c ) + (v + w + d) = 180

o 4

... (p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w) + (a + b + c + d) = 720

Since a, b, c and d are angles around the point O, a + b + c + d = 360

ii. Show that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon of n sides is 180

Note: Historically, mathematicians such as the Greek mathematician Euclid,

expressed the magnitudes of angles in terms of right angles. For example, the magnitude of the angle on a straight line was said to be 2 right angles and the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral was said to be 4 right angles. Accordingly, we can say that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon of n sides is 2n – 4 right angles. However, since we use degrees to measure angles and are familiar with the fact that a right angle is 90

o, the sum of the interior angles of a polygon can be remembered as either 90

o(2n – 4) or 180

o(n – 2) or any other equivalent expression which is easy to recall.

First, let us find the sum of the exterior angles of a triangle.

A

The side BC of the triangle ABC has been produced and point D has been marked on the produced line. The angle ACD

, with the straight line segment CD and the side AC as arms is an exterior angle of this triangle.

As indicated in the figure given below, by producing the side AC too we obtain an exterior angle.

A

58For free distribution.

Since vertically opposite angles are equal, this exterior angle is equal in magnitude to the exterior angle ACD

>

. Either of these two angles can be considered as the exterior angle drawn at the vertex C of the triangle. However, DCE

is not considered as an exterior angle.

As done above, exterior angles can be drawn at the vertices A and B of the triangle too.

We can define the exterior angles of a quadrilateral similarly.

P

S

B

By producing the side SR of the quadrilateral PQRS up to A we obtain the exterior angle QRA

and by producing the side QR up to B we obtain the exterior angle SRB

. Since vertically opposite angles are equal, these two exterior angles are equal.

Furthermore, ARB

is not considered as an exterior angle.

We can define the exterior angles of any polygon similarly.

Now, through the following activity, let us determine a value for the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon.

Step 2: Using a blade, cut out the exterior angles as laminas (in the form of

Step 3: On a sheet of paper, paste the laminas which were cut out, such that

their vertices meet at one point and such that they don’t overlap each other.

Step 4: Carry out the above steps for a hexagon and a heptagon too.

Step 5: Write the common characteristic of the figures obtained by pasting

the exterior angles of the polygons and write what can be concluded through this activity too.

You may have observed in the above activity that for each polygon, the exterior angles cover the angle around a point. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is equal to the sum of the angles around a point. As the sum of the angles around a point is 360°, the sum of the exterior angles of the above polygons is also 360°.

60For free distribution.

Now let us obtain an expression for the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon which has n sides.We know that the number of exterior angles and the number of interior angles of a polygon with n sides is n.

At any vertex of a polygon, the interior angle + the exterior angle = 180

o.... sum of n interior angles + sum of n exterior angles = 180

o n'But the sum of n interior angles = (2n – 4) right angles = 180°(n − 2). Therefore,180

26.2 Adding and subtracting algebraic fractions with unequal

integral denominators

Now let us consider how to simplify expressions of algebraic fractions with unequal

integral denominators such as x

6 + 3x

4 . These types of fractions can be simplified

in the same way that numerical fractions are simplified. A common multiple

71For free distribution.

of the denominators of the fractions can be taken as the common denominator. However simplification is made easier by taking the least common multiple of the denominators.

For example, the denominators of the above two fractions are 6 and 4. Their least common multiple is 12. Therefore, initially, the above fractions need to be converted

into fractions with denominator 12. To convert x

6 into a fraction with denominator

12, the denominator and numerator of x

6 need to be multiplied by 2. (Observe that

2 is obtained from 12

6 &' Similarly, to convert 3x

4 into a fraction with denominator

12, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator of 3x

4 by 3. (Observe that

3 is obtained from 12

4 ). Accordingly, we may write the following to simplify the given expression.

x

6 + 3x

4 = 2

2 × x

6 + 3

3 × 3x

4When we simplify the numerator and the denominator of these fractions we obtain the following.

2x 12 + 9x

12

Now since both fractions have a common denominator, we can write the above as follows.

2x + 9x

12By simplifying this we get 11x

12 '

Accordingly, x

6 + 3x

4 = 11x

20 − 16v

20

= 29v

20 You may have observed in the above examples that when the denominators are not equal, it is easy to simplify by taking the L.C.M. of the unequal denominators as the common denominator.

Now let us consider instances where we have to multiply an algebraic expression by a number. Here it is important to remember to write the algebraic expression within brackets.

Scale Diagrams27

By studying this lesson you will be able to;² identify bearings,² draw a scale diagram of locations in a horizontal plane when bearings and distances are given, and find unknown quantities using the scale diagram.

27.1 Bearing

Bearing is a measurement that is used to indicate a direction in a horizontal plane. The bearing of the point B from the point A is the angle that the direction AB makes with the direction of North when measured from A in a clockwise direction. The following figures illustrate the bearing of B from A for different locations of A and B. Observe that the bearing is given in three digits.

Since a bearing is always less than 360°, the maximum number of digits it can have is three. Therefore the norm is to always write bearings with three digits. If the angle is one of 1

o, 2

o, ..., 9

o, then the bearing is written as 001o, 002o, ..., 009o and if the angle is one of 10

o, 11

o, ..., 99

o, then it is written as 010o, 011o, ..., 099o.

Accordingly bearing is,

i. measured starting from the North,ii. measured in a clockwise direction,iii. written with three digits.

Since the North can be easily identified using a compass, bearings are used widely in sea and air travel.

Let us broaden our knowledge on bearings by studying the examples given below.

Example 1

i. Indicate the four main directions (cardinal directions) in terms of bearings.

Example 2 The bearing of B from A is 065o. Illustrate this information in a rough sketch and find the bearing of A from B.

Now, to find the bearing of A from B, a line needs to be drawn in the direction of North from B, and the angle that is formed when this line is rotated in a clockwise direction about B from the direction of North to the direction of BA needs to be found.

In every scale diagram, the scale to which the diagram is drawn is given, and the direction of North is marked. It is very important to understand what is meant by the scale (ratio) given in the scale diagram. For example, a scale of 1 : 500 000 means that a distance of 500 000 cm is represented by 1 cm in the scale diagram. In

other words, the distance between two points on the scale diagram is 500 000

1th of

the actual distance between the two points. Moreover, since 500 000 cm is equal to 5 km, the actual distance represented by 1 cm in the scale diagram is 5 km.

Now let us learn how to draw scale diagrams by considering some examples.

Example 1 The vertices of a triangular floor area are A, B and C. The positions of the vertices with respect to a point P located in this area is given below.

With respect to P,

87For free distribution.

² A is located 30 m away on a bearing of 000

o ² B is located 40 m away on a bearing of 120

o² C is located 45 m away on a bearing of 220

o

Draw a scale diagram of the floor area using this information and find its perimeter.

Step 1: Mark the direction of North at the top right hand corner of the sheet of

paper.

Step 2: Draw a rough sketch as shown, based on the

information that is given.

Step 3: To represent the distances 30 m, 40 m and 45 m, select the scale of 1 cm

representing 10 m, that is, the scale of 1:1000.(Here, the scale should be selected according to the size of the sheet of paper. Moreover, by selecting a value such as 1000, anyone who is examining the scale diagram can easily get an idea of the actual distances represented in it.)

Step 4: For each distance that is to be represented in the scale diagram, calculate

the corresponding length using the selected scale.

PA = 3000 × 1000

1 cm = 3 cm PB = 4000 × 1000

1 cm = 4 cm,

PC = 4500 × 1000

1 cm = 4.5 cm

Step 5: Using a straight edge with a cm scale and a protractor, draw the scale

diagram with a pencil as shown below.

² First draw the line segment AP of length 3cm upwards. ² Draw the line segment PB of length 4 cm which makes an angle of 120

o

clockwise with PA.² Draw the line segment PC of length 4.5 cm which makes an angle of 100

o

clockwisewith PB.

88For free distribution.

² Draw the line segments AB, BC and AC.

Step 6: Measure the lengths of AB, BC and AC. You will see that AB = 6 cm,

AC = 7.1 cm and BC = 6.5 cm. Therefore the perimeter of the scale diagram is 6 + 7.1 + 6.5 = 19.6 cm.

Step 7: Using the scale 1 cm 10 m, calculate the actual length. Perimeter of the floor = 10 × 19.6 = 196 m

Example 2 A ship journeying from harbour P approaches harbour Q after travelling 100 km on a bearing of 048

o. It then travels 125 km on a bearing of 110

o and approaches harbour R. Draw a scale diagram and describe the position of R with respect to P.

o, the angle that QR makes with the direction of North at Q is 110

Step 3: Select the scale of 1 cm representing 25 km, that is, 1: 2 500 000 to represent

the distances 100 km and 125 km in the scale diagram. (If there is space on the sheet of paper, the scale of 1:1 250 000 can also be used).

Step 4: According to the selected scale, calculate the lengths of by which PQ and

QR are to be represented in the scale diagram. PQ = 25

100 cm = 4 cm, QR = 25

125 cm = 5 cm

(When drawing scale diagrams, the magnitudes of the angles do not change.)

Step 5: Draw the scale diagram using a straight edge, a protractor and a pencil,

based on the above measurements.

Data Representation and Interpretation28

By studying this lesson you will be able to;

²² construct an ungrouped frequency distribution from given raw data,²² find the mode, median and mean of data in the form of an ungrouped frequency

distribution,²² construct a grouped frequency distribution from given raw data,²² identify the modal class and median class from a grouped frequency distribution.

In Grade 8 you learnt how to find the mode, median and mean of given raw data. Do the following review exercise to recall what was learnt.

94For free distribution.

28.1 Ungrouped frequency distribution

To extract the information we require from a given set of raw data, we need to first organize the data in a suitable way. For example, to find a representative value such as the median of a set of raw data, the data needs to be arranged in ascending or descending order.

When there are only a few values, they can easily be arranged in ascending or descending order. However when the number of data is large, arranging them in order and extracting information is not that easy. In such instances it is more appropriate to use tables.

Let us consider such an instance.

The marks obtained in a test by the students of a certain class are given below.

42, 70, 68, 68, 56, 62, 74, 74. 74, 56, 62, 85, 91, 91, 74, 74, 56, 68, 68, 68, 74

This information can be tabulated as follows.

Note: This table can be easily and accurately constructed by using tally marks.

The frequencies are shown in the third column of this table. Let us first consider what is meant by frequency.

95For free distribution.

In the above data set, the value 42 occurs once, the value 56 occurs three time, etc. The frequency of a value is the number of times that value occurs in the data set.

Accordingly, if we consider the above data set,

the frequency of 42 is 1,the frequency of 56 is 3,the frequency of 62 is 2, etc.

An ungrouped frequency distribution is a table containing the values of a data set and their respective frequencies.The following is an ungrouped frequency distribution prepared using the above data set.

12The mode of the data in an ungrouped frequency distributionYou have learnt in Grade 8 that the mode of a data set is the value that is repeated the most in that data set. The largest value in the frequency column of the above table is 6. The value corresponding to the frequency 6 is 74. Therefore the mode of the above data set is 74.

The median of the data in an ungrouped frequency distributionYou have learnt that the median of a data set is the value that occurs in the middle when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order.

There are 21 data in the above example. Therefore, when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order, the value that occurs in the middle is the 11th value. Now we need to find out what the 11th value is.

96For free distribution.

Let us consider how this is done.Observe from the above table that,

the 1st value is 42, the 2nd value is 56, the 3rd value is also 56,'''the 6th value is 62.

Accordingly, the 11th value can be found by considering the sums of the values in the frequency column as shown below.

Let us write the sums of the values in the frequency column by the side of the frequency table.

1 3 + 1 = 4 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 5 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 11

It can easily be seen by considering the sums of the frequencies in the frequency column that the value in the 11th position is 68.

When there is a large number of data, arranging it in ascending or descending order and identifying the middle value may not be very easy. The following method can be used to identify the middle position (the position of the median).

Note: When the total number of data is an odd number, the middle position is obtained from number of data + 1

2 = 11

The value in the 11th position is 68. Therefore, the median of the data set is 68; that is, the median of the marks is 68.

The mean of the data in an ungrouped frequency distribution You have learnt in Grade 8 that to find the mean of a data set, the sum of all the data values needs to be divided by the number of data values.

Let us see how the mean of the data in an ungrouped frequency distribution is found by considering the above example.

As indicated previously, the value 42 occurs once, the value 56 occurs 3 times, etc. To find the mean, the sum of all the values has to be found.

Let us use a table of the following form to find this sum. MarksFrequency

There are 36 values in this data set. Since 36 is an even number, when this data set is arranged in ascending or descending order, we obtain two middle values. In such a case, the median of the data set is the average of the middle two values.

Let us first find the positions of the middle two values.

Note: When the total number of data is even, the positions of the middle two values

are obtained from number of data

28.2 Grouped frequency distributions

In this section we will identify what a grouped frequency distribution is, the need for grouped frequency distributions and how they are constructed.

To do this, let us consider the following example.

The marks obtained by a group of students in a certain test is given below.

21 26 28 32 34 36 36 38 39 39 39 40 41 41 41 41 42 45 48 48 52 53 56 66 68 70 75 80 81 83

The highest mark obtained is 83 and the lowest mark obtained is 21.Therefore the range = 83 – 21 = 62.

102For free distribution.

Since the range is large and there are many distinct data values, if we try to prepare an ungrouped frequency distribution, we will end up with a fairly long table. In such instances we consider the range of the data set and prepare a table of intervals such that each data value belongs to exactly one of the intervals. These intervals are called class intervals. A frequency distribution prepared using class intervals is called a grouped frequency distribution.

The following is an example of a grouped frequency distribution.

Class Interval Frequency

10 - 1920 - 2930 - 3940 - 49

This distribution has four class intervals.

Any data value which is equal to one of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 belongs to the class interval 10 – 19.

Since there are 10 values in the class interval 10 – 19, the class size (or class width) is considered to be 10. The class sizes of the other class intervals are defined similarly.

The frequency corresponding to the class interval 10 – 19 is 3. This means that the data set has only 3 values belonging to this class interval.

Now let us consider how a grouped frequency distribution is prepared.

When preparing a grouped frequency distribution, we need to first decide on either the size of the class intervals or the number of class intervals we want to have.

When we have decided on the size of the class intervals, the number of class intervals can be obtained as follows.

• Find the range of the data set.• Divide the range by the size of a class interval. • The number of class intervals is the nearest whole number greater or equal to

the above obtained value.

103For free distribution.

Consider the following example which was discussed earlier.

The marks obtained by a group of 30 students in a certain test are given below.

21 26 28 32 34 36 36 38 39 39 39 40 41 41 41 41 42 45 48 48 52 53 56 66 68 70 75 80 81 83 Suppose we want to separate this data set into class intervals of size 10.

Let us first find the number of class intervals.

The largest value of this data set = 83The smallest value of this data set = 21 The range = 83 – 21 = 62Since we want the size of the class intervals to be 10,

the number of class intervals = 62

10

= 6.2 7 (when rounded off to the nearest whole number greater than the obtained value)

Accordingly, if we take the class size to be 10, we obtain a grouped frequency distribution with 7 class intervals.

Since the smallest value in the data set is 21, let us prepare the frequency distribution starting with the value 20. The first class interval will then consist of the ten integers 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29. The next class interval will consist of the next 10 integers and so on.

Accordingly, we obtain the following class intervals.

20 - 29

30 - 39

40 - 49

50 - 59

60 - 69

70 - 79

80 - 89

104For free distribution.

Note: Although we commenced the first class interval from 20, we could have

started with the value 21 too (or some other suitable value). If we started with 21, the class intervals would have been 21 – 30, 31 – 40, 41 – 50, etc.

Now, let us find the number of values that fall into each class interval by using tally marks.

Note: It is not necessary to include the tally marks column in a frequency distribution.

When we have decided on the number of class intervals, we can find the size of the class intervals (class size) as follows.

• Find the range of the data set by subtracting the smallest value of the data set

from the largest value.

• Divide the range by the number of class intervals. (In general, the number of

class intervals is taken to be less than 10.)

• Round off the value that is obtained to the nearest whole number greater or

equal to it and take this value to be the size of the class intervals.

Let us consider how to construct a grouped frequency distribution with 5 class intervals using the above data set. Let us first find the size of the class intervals.

105For free distribution.

The largest value of this data set = 83 The smallest value of this data set = 21

The range = 83 – 21 = 62

Since we require 5 class intervals,

the size of each class interval = 62

5

= 12.4 13 (nearest whole number greater than the obtained value)

Accordingly, we prepare a grouped frequency distribution with 5 class intervals of size 13.

As shown above, we can construct grouped frequency distributions according to our requirements, based on the given data set.

Consider the first grouped frequency distribution we constructed. We took 20 - 29 as the first class interval, 30 – 39 as the second class interval, etc. We were able to do this because there were no values between 29 and 30 or between 39 and 40, etc. Observe that this feature is seen in the second grouped frequency distribution we constructed too.

However, if we have a data set consisting of values which are lengths or times or masses, it is necessary to start the second class interval with the value that the first class interval ends, to start the third class interval with the value that the second class interval ends, and so on.

106For free distribution.

Let us now consider such an example.

The masses of 20 students in a class are given below to the nearest kilogramme.

31 31 31 32 32 32 32 33 33 34 34 34 35 36 36 38 39 39 40 41Let us construct a grouped frequency distribution with 4 class intervals of size 3 each.

Let us take the first class interval as 30 – 33, the next class interval as 33 – 36, etc.

30 - 33

33 - 36

36 - 39

39 - 42

Here, the second class interval commences with the same value that the first class interval ends. The reason is because the data set consists of masses and masses need not be integral values. For example, we may have students whose masses are 33.2 kg, 33.5 kg, 33.8 kg, etc., which are between 33 kg and 34 kg, or 36.5 kg, 36.9 kg, etc., which are between 36 kg and 37 kg etc. Therefore, in such situations, each class interval needs to commence with the same value that the previous class interval ends (except for the first class interval).

Here, the first class interval ends with 33 and the second class interval commences with the same value 33. A question arises as to which class interval the value 33 belongs. The value 33 can be taken to belong to either one of these two intervals. However, it is important to state the convention that is being used.In this lesson we will consider the class intervals to be as follows.

Here, the values greater than 30 but less than or equal to 33 belong to the class interval 30 -33,the values greater than 33 but less than or equal to 36 belong to the class interval 33 – 36, the values greater than 36 but less than or equal to 39 belong to the class interval 36 – 39, and the values greater than 39 but less than or equal to 42 belong to the class interval 39 – 42.

The grouped frequency distribution prepared according to this convention is given below.

Note: When constructing a grouped frequency distribution, it should be remembered that the class intervals need to be selected by taking the nature of the data into consideration.

28.3 Finding the modal class and median class from a grouped frequency distribution

We learnt how to construct a grouped frequency distribution in the previous section. Now let us consider how the modal class and the median class can be found from a grouped frequency distribution.

When we are given a grouped frequency distribution, we will not be able to identify the mode and the median as the raw data is not available to us. In such situations we consider the modal class and the median class.

The modal class is the class interval with the highest frequency. The median class is the class interval to which the median belongs.

Example 1
