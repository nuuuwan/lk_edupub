Direct Proportion10

By studying this lesson you will be able to;

² identify direct proportions,

² solve problems related to direct proportion using the unitary method,

² solve problems related to direct proportion using the definition,

² write the relationship between two directly proportional quantities in the form y = kx,

² solve problems related to the conversion of foreign currencies using the

knowledge on direct proportions.

10.1 Introduction to direct proportion

The way the price of a certain type of pen varies depending on the quantity of pens is given in the following table.

Number of

pens

Price (Rs)

1

2

3

4

5

6

15

30

45

60

75

90

It is clear from the above table that the price increases as the number of pens increases. Let us consider the number of pens and the price as two quantities.

2For free distribution.

Based on the above example, a few ratios of different amount of pens and the ratios of the corresponding prices are shown in the following table. Observe that these ratios are equal.

Ratio of two amounts of

pens

Ratio of the corresponding

prices

1 : 215 : 30 = 1 : 2

1 : 315 : 45 = 1 : 3

2 : 330 : 45 = 2 : 33 : 545 : 75 = 3 : 5

2 : 530 : 75 = 2 : 5

Two distinct quantities are said to be in direct proportion if they increase or decrease in the same ratio.

Therefore, if two quantities are in direct proportion, then when one quantity increases, the other quantity will also increase in the same ratio. Similarly, if two quantities are in direct proportion and one quantity decreases, then the other quantity will also decrease in the same ratio.

Exercise 10.1

1. For each of the cases given below, write whether the two quantities are directly

proportional or not.

a. The number of books and the price b. The distance travelled by an object moving at a constant speed and the time taken for the journey.

c. The speed of a vehicle and the time taken to travel a certain distance

d. The length of a side of a square and its perimeter

e. The length of a side of a square and its area

f. The number of people needed to finish a task and the number of days taken for it g. The number of units of electricity consumed by a household and the monthly bill

10. 2 Solving problems related to direct proportion using the unitary method

Suppose we want to find the price of 5 cakes of a certain type of soap, given that the price of 3 cakes of soap of that type is Rs 120.

As you have learnt in previous grades, we can first find the price of one cake of soap and thereby easily find the price of 5 cakes of soap.

Price of 3 cakes of soap = Rs 120 Price of 1 cake of soap = Rs 120 ÷ 3 = Rs 40 Price of 5 cakes of soap = Rs 40 × 5 = Rs 200

This method of calculation can also be explained as follows.

There are two quantities. They are the number of cakes of soap and the price. Initially the price of one cake of soap is found. It is Rs. 40. To find the price of five cakes of soap, the price of one cake of soap is multiplied by 5. Here the price of one cake of soap is clearly the constant value of the following fraction.

price of 3 cakes of soap

number of cakes of soap

The method of solving a problem based on the value of a unit is called the

unitary method.

Let us learn how to solve problems related to direct proportion using the unitary method by considering a few examples.

Example 1 If a person walking at a constant speed takes 5 minutes to walk 800 m, calculate the distance he walks in 12 minutes.

Distance walked in 5 minutes in metres = 800 Distance walked in 1 minute in metres = 800 ÷ 5 = 160 Distance walked in 12 minutes in metres = 160 × 12 = 1 920 ∴ The distance walked in 12 minutes is 1920 m.

Example 2 If the mass of 10 identical balls used in a cricket match is 3 kg, what is the mass of 3 such balls?

Mass of 10 balls in kilogrammes = 3

Mass of 1 ball in grammes = 3000 ÷ 10 = 300Mass of 3 balls in grammes = 300 × 3 = 900∴ The mass of 3 balls is 900g.

Do the following exercise using the unitary method.

Exercise 10.2

1. If the price of 8 oranges is Rs 320, find the price of 5 such oranges.

2. If the price of 5 m of a certain fabric is Rs 750, find the price of 12 m of that fabric.

3. If the mass of a parcel containing 15 apples is 3.6 kg, find the mass of a parcel containing 8 such apples. 4. If a printing machine makes 240 copies in 5 minutes, determine the number of copies it makes in 12 minutes.

5. If a motor vehicle moving at a constant speed travels 12 km in 15 minutes, calculate the distance it travels in 40 minutes.

6. If a motorbike can travel 90 km on 2 l of petrol, find the distance it can travel

on 5 l of petrol.

7. If the time taken for a tank of capacity 1000 litres to be filled using a pump that

releases water at a constant rate is 5 minutes, find the time taken in seconds to fill a tank of capacity 1600 litres.

10.3 Solving problems related to direct proportion using the definition

In the first section of this lesson it was explained that if two quantities are directly proportional, then the ratio of any two values of the first quantity is equal to the ratio of the corresponding values of the second quantity. This can be shown algebraically as below. Let us assume that the price of an amount a of a certain item is Rs u and the price of an amount b of the same item is Rs v.

a

b

u

v

Then we can write a : b = u : v.

This can be expressed in terms of fractions as a

b = u

v ( or b

a = v

u ). By cross multiplication, a × v = b × uLet us learn how to solve problems related to direct proportion using this feature by considering the following examples.

Example 1 If the price of 5 mangoes is Rs 75, find the price of 8 mangoes.

Let us take the price of 8 mangoes as x. Then we can illustrate this information using an arrow diagram as shown below.

Number of mangoes Price (Rs)

5 758 x

Using this as the base, let us write an algebraic equation as shown below and by solving it, find the value of x; that is, the price of 8 mangoes.

5 : 8 = 75 : x

Therefore, 5

8 = 75

x

5x = 75 × 8

x = 75 × 8

5

x = 120

Accordingly, the price of 8 mangoes is Rs 120.

6For free distribution.

Example 2 Find the price at which an item bought for Rs 500 should be sold to earn a profit of 15%.

Let us write the information in this problem as follows, so that we can use direct proportions. “If the selling price of an item bought for Rs 100 is Rs 115 (since the profit is 15%), find the selling price of an item bought for Rs 500.”

Let us assume that the selling price of an item bought for Rs 500 is Rs x.

Purchase price (Rs) Selling price (Rs)

100 115 500 x

100 : 500 = 115 : x

100500 = 115

x

100 x = 115 × 500

x = 115 × 500

100

x = 575Accordingly, the selling price should be Rs 575.

Exercise 10.31. For each of the proportions given below, write the suitable value in the blank space.

a. 2 : 5 = 8 : ...... b. 3 : 4 = ...... : 20 c. 5 : 3 = 40 : ...... d. 4 : 1 = ...... : 8 e. 8 : ...... = 24 : 15 f. ...... : 6 = 35 : 30

2. Solve each problem given below using proportions, by first drawing an arrow

diagram and then writing an algebraic equation.

a. If the price of 10 kg of rice is Rs 850, find the price of 7 kg of rice.

b. If the mass of 9 cm3 of a certain type of metal is 108 g, find the mass of 12 cm3 of this metal.

7For free distribution.

c. If the distance travelled in 4 hours by a motorbike moving at a constant speed is 240 km, find the distance travelled by it in 3 hours.

d. Find the amount needed to buy an item worth Rs 800 from a shop which offers a discount of 3%.

e. If a commission of 12% is given when an item is sold, what is the commission given for an item worth Rs 15 000?

f. If the price of 4 pencils is Rs 48, find the number of pencils that can be bought for Rs 132.

g. If the price of 12 bottles is Rs 4800, find the number of bottles that can be bought for Rs 6000.

10.4 Solving problems related to direct proportion algebraically

If the price of 1 pen is Rs 15, then

² the price of 2 pens is Rs 30.

² the price of 3 pens is Rs 45.

² the price of 4 pens is Rs 60.

If we consider the above four instances, it can be observed that if the amount of money spent is divided by the number of pens, the value that is obtained is a constant.

That is, money spent

number of pens = constant value.

This constant value is the price of one pen. Accordingly, if the money spent for x pens is y,

we can write y

x = k ; here k is a constant.

This equation can also be written as y = kx.

Let us learn how to solve problems related to direct proportions using the above algebraic equation, by considering the following examples.

8For free distribution.

Example 1 If the price of 3 exercise books is Rs 75, find the price of 5 such exercise books. Let us take the number of books as x and the price as y.

Then we can write y = kx; where k is a constant. The value of k can be found using the information given in the problem.

Since the price of 3 exercise books is Rs 75, when x = 3, y = 75.

By substituting these values in the equation we obtain, 75 = k × 3.By solving this we obtain k = 25.

By substituting this value of k in the first equation, we obtain the relationship between x and y as y = 25x.

Now, using this equation, for any value of x the corresponding value of y and for any value of y the corresponding value of x can be found.In this problem, since we need the price of 5 exercise books, y needs to be found when x = 5.

By substituting x = 5 in the equation y = 25x we get,

y = 25 × 5

= 125

Accordingly, the price of 5 exercise books is Rs 125.

Example 2

If a vendor sells an item he bought for Rs 500 such that he earns a profit of 20%, determine the selling price of the item.

Taking the purchase price of the item as x and selling price as y we can write y

x = k'

Since the selling price is Rs 120 when the purchase price is Rs 100, we obtain

120

100 = k.

Let us assume that the selling price of an item bought for Rs 500 is y. Then we

obtain the equation y

500 = k'

9For free distribution.

Since k is a constant, we can write, y

500 = 120

100 .

Therefore, y = 120 × 500

100.

y = 600.

∴ The selling price of the item is Rs 600.

Exercise 10.4Do the problems in this exercise, using the algebraic equation method.

1. If the price of 3 shirts is Rs 1200, find the price of 5 shirts.

2. If the daily wage of 8 labourers who are paid equal wages is Rs 7200, find the

daily wage of 3 labourers.

3. If a distance of 25 m is represented by 5 cm on a map drawn to scale, find the

actual distance represented by 8 cm on this map.

4. If a machine in a factory produces 7500 drink bottles in 5 hours, find the

number of drink bottles it produces in 7 hours.

5. A bookstore offers a discount of 8% on every book that is purchased. Find the

amount a person has to pay if he purchases books worth Rs 1 200.

10.5 Foreign currency

We know that every country has its own currency unit and that the rate of conversion of the currency of one country to that of another country varies depending on the countries. The rate at which one country exchanges its currency with that of another country is called the exchange rate. This rate is not a constant value; it increases and decreases daily due to various reasons.

The currency units used by certain countries and their exchange rates with respect to the Sri Lankan rupee on a particular day, is given below.

Here the exchange rate given is the value of one foreign currency unit in Sri Lankan rupees.

JapanYen1.33

IndiaIndian Rupee2.26

Saudi ArabiaSaudi Riyal40.32

SingaporeSingapore Dollar107.30

^From the internet on 2017-03-05&

Now let us consider how to solve problems related to exchange rates using proportions.

Example 1 On a day that the exchange rate is Rs 151 for an American dollar, how many Sri Lankan rupees will a person who converts 50 American dollars receive?

Value of 1 American dollar = Rs 151 Value of 50 American dollars = Rs 151 × 50

= Rs 7550

Therefore, the person will receive Rs 7550.

Example 2 A person visiting England, converted Rs 74 000 into sterling pounds on a day when the exchange rate was Rs 185 for a sterling pound. How many sterling pounds did he receive?

The value of 185 Sri Lankan rupees = 1 sterling pound

The value of 1 Sri Lankan rupee = 1

185 sterling pounds

The value of 74 000 Sri Lankan rupees = 1

185 × 74 000 sterling pounds

= 400 sterling pounds

^ It is easy to simplify this if we keep 1

185 as a fraction without converting it into a decimal number&. Therefore, the amount of sterling pounds he received is 400.

Exercise 10.5Do the following exercise by using the exchange rate table given earlier.

1. If the monthly salary of a person working in a foreign country is 1500 American

dollars, what is his salary in Sri Lankan rupees?

2. If the price of a television set imported from Japan is 12 500 yen, what is its value

in Sri Lankan rupees?

3. A monthly allowance of 2500 sterling pounds is given to a scholarship student

engaged in further studies in Great Britain. How much is this amount in Sri Lankan rupees?

4. A sports equipment in a duty free shop is worth 750 euros. How many Sri Lankan

rupees have to be paid to purchase it?

5. A pilgrim who travels to India, converts 56 000 Sri Lankan rupees into Indian

rupees. How many Indian rupees does he receive?

6. How many Singapore dollars are received when readymade garments worth

Rs 600 880 are exported from Sri Lanka to Singapore?

The Calculator11

By studying this lesson you will be able to" ² identify and use the keys of =, %, x2 and x in the scientific calculator.

The Calculator

Since ancient times, humans have used various devices to perform calculations. During the period when animal husbandry commenced, men used pebbles to count the number of animals they owned. There is evidence to show that counting was done by drawing lines on clay tablets during a later period. The Egyptians started using a device known as the abacus for calculations in 1000 B.C. The modern day abacus was invented by the Chinese in the 15th century. John Napier who lived in the 17th century invented “Napier’s bones” which is a device that was used to calculate products and quotients of numbers.

Egyptian abacus Modern abacus

The first mechanical calculator was invented by the French mathematician Blaise Pascal(1623-1662). In the year 1833, the Englishman Charles Babbage (1791-1871) introduced a more advanced calculator. Based on this, the electrically operated computer was invented. The production of the modern compact calculators commenced with the development of electronics.

Nowadays, two types of calculators are manufactured. They are the ordinary calculators and the scientific calculators. Ordinary calculators can perform only normal mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square roots. However, by using a scientific calculator, operations such as x2, x3 yx, 10

xcan be performed..

The Scientific Calculator

The scientific calculator, like the ordinary calculator, consists of a key pad to enter data and a screen to display results. However, the number of keys on the keypad and the number of digits that can be displayed on the screen of a scientific calculator are greater than those of an ordinary calculator.

Exercise 11.1

Performing calculations using an ordinary calculator or a scientific calculator

Let us consider how simplifications are done using a calculator when more than one operation is involved.

In simplifying 75 + 6 ÷ 3 using an ordinary calculator, when the keys are pressed in the order

ON756÷3=+ , the operations are performed in the order that they have been entered and 27 is obtained as the answer. That is, a wrong answer is obtained by 75 + 6 ÷ 3 = 81 ÷ 3 = 27. (This is wrong according to the “BODMAS Rule”.)

When we enter the above data in a scientific calculator in the same order, the operations are performed according to the accepted order of performing mathematical operations and the answer 77 is obtain by performing the operations as follows: 75 + 6 ÷ 3 = 75 + 2 = 77.

Note: When performing calculations using an ordinary calculator, the order in which

data is entered should be chosen with care. However, the correct answer can be obtained when data is entered into a scientific calculator in the order in which they appear. Most manufacturers of calculators follow the BODMAS rule when programming their products. However, there are some calculators that do not perform the operations according to this rule. The order in which data should be entered into these calculators is indicated in the instruction booklet that is provided. If such a booklet is not available, an understanding of how the calculator operates can be gained by performing a few simple calculations. Otherwise, the operations that need to be performed initially have to be enclosed within brackets. For example, if the data in the expression 1 − 5 + 12 ÷ 3 × 2 is entered in the given order, some calculators may perform the multiplication before the division. However, according to the BODMAS rule, since multiplication and division have the same priority, moving from left to right, the division should be peformed first.

By studying this lesson you will be able to;

• identify the laws of indices on the product of powers, the quotient of powers and the power of a power,• simplify algebraic expressions using the above mentioned laws of indices,• identify the zero index and negative indices and simplify algebraic expressions containing these.

Indices

You have learnt about powers of numbers such as 21, 22 and 23 in previous grades. The values of these powers can be obtained as follows.

21 = 222 = 2 2 = 4 23 = 2 2 2 = 8. .. .. .

You have also learnt about powers of algebraic symbols such as x1, x2 and x3 .These can be expanded and written as follows. x1 = xx2 = x x x3 = x x x. .. .. .Moreover, you have learnt how to write the expanded form of a product of powers of algebraic symbols and numerical values. For example, 52a3b2 is written in expanded form as follows.

52a3b2 = 5 5 a a a b b'

You have also learnt that a power of a product such as (xy)2 can be expressed as a

product of powers as x2 y2 and a power of a quotient such as xy

3. Expand and write each of the following expressions as a product.

i. 2a2 ii. 3x2y2 iii. – 5p2q iv. (– 3)5 v. (ab)3 vi. x4 y4

12.1 Products of powers with the same base

23 and 25 are two powers with the same base.They can be expanded and written as follows.

23 = 2 2 2 and 25 = 2 2 2 2 2

Let us obtain the product of these two powers.

23 25 = (2 2 2) (2 2 2 2 2) = 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 = 28

2 is repeatedly multiplied three times in 23. Furthermore, 2 is repeatedly multiplied five times in 25.

23For free distribution.

Therefore, when multiplying 23 by 25, 2 is repeatedly multiplied 3 + 5 = 8 times.

This can be expressed as 23 25 = 23 + 5 = 28.

It is important to remember that when two powers are multiplied, their indices can be added only if they have the same base. Then the base of the power that is obtained is also this common base.

Let us obtain the product x3 × x5 accordingly. Since x3 and x5 have the same base, the two indices are added to get the product. That is, x3 x5 = x3 + 5

= x8

This can be expressed as a law of indices as follows.

am an = am + n

This law can be extended to any number of powers. For example,am an ap = am + n + p

Let us understand how this law is used to simplify expressions by considering some examples.

Example 1

Simplify the following.

i. x2 x5 x ii. a2 b2 a2 b3 iii. 2x2 3x5

i. x2 x5 x = x2 + 5 + 1

= x8

ii. a2 b2 a2 b3 = a2 a2 b2 b3 = a2 + 2 b2 + 3

= a4 b5

= a4 b5

12.2 Quotients of powers with the same base

Let us see whether there is a law of indices for the quotients of powers with the same base, similar to the one obtained above for the product.

x5 .

.

x2 can also be expressed as x5x2 '

Now, x5x2 = x x x x xx x = x x x = x3

... x5x2 = x3' When the index of the power in the numerator is 5 and the index of the power in the denominator is 2, then the index of the quotient is 5 – 2 = 3. The base of the quotient is x, which is the common base of the original two powers.

Therefore, x5 .

.

x2 can be simplified easily by subtracting the indices as follows.

x5 .

.

x2 = x5 – 2 = x3 When powers with the same base are divided, the index of the divisor is subtracted from the index of the dividend. The base remains the same.

am .

.

an = am – n

It is important to remember this law of indices too. Let us understand how this law is used to simplify expressions by considering the following examples.

Example 1 Simplify the following expressions.

12.3 Negative indices

In the previous section we identified that x5 .

.

x2 is x3. We know that this can be

obtained by expanding x5x2 and simplifying it as follows.

x x x x xx x

11

11 = x3

Let us simplify x2 .

.

x5 in a similar manner.

27For free distribution.

i. When expanded, ii. Using laws of indices,

x2x5 = x x x x xx x 11

11 x2x5 = x2 – 5

= 1x3 = x – 3

The two simplifications of x2 .

.

x5 obtained in (i) and (ii) above must be equal. Therefore, 1x3 = x – 3. Observe here that the index of the power in the denominator changes signs when it is brought to the numerator. This is an important feature related to indices which can be used when we need to change a negative index into

a positive index. We can similarly write x3 = 1x – 3 .

This law can be expressed as follows.

xn= 1x –n

Accordingly, a –m 1am=a m ==1a –m a–m a–nanam,, (By applying the above feature

to both powers simultaneously)

We can use this law of indices to simplify algebraic expressions as shown in the following examples.

Example 1

Evaluate the following.

(i) 2–5 (ii) 1

12.4 Zero index A power of which the index is zero, is known as a power with zero index. 20 is an example of a power with zero index.

When x5 .

.

x5 is simplified using the laws of indices we obtain,

x5 .

.

x5 = x5 – 5 = x0

When it is expanded and simplified we obtain, x5 .

.

x5 = x x x x xx x x x x

= 1Since the answers obtained when x5 .

.

x5 is simplified by the two methods should be the same, we obtain x0 = 1'

x0 = 1 where, x is any number except 0'

This result is also used when simplifying algebraic expressions.

12.5 Power of a power

(x2)3 is the third power of x2 . A power of this type is known as a power of a power.We can simplify this as follows.

(x2)3 = x2 x2 x2 (x2)3 = (x x) (x x) (x x) = x x x x x x= x6

Therefore, (x2)3 = x6'Observe that the index 6 is 3 twos; that is, 2 × 3. Therefore, we can write (x2)3 = x2 3 = x6'Hence, when simplifying an algebraic expression of a power of a power, the indices are multiplied.This is also a law of indices which can be expressed as follows. (am)n = am n = amn

Example 1 Simplify the following.

Introduction

 It is the opinion of scientists that dinosaurs are a species of animals that lived on

earth 140 000 000 years ago.

 The atomic radius of the Hydrogen atom is 0.000 000 000 053 m.

 The distance from the sun to the earth is 149 600 000 000 m.

 The speed of light is 299 790 000 meters per second.

The above are four instances where numbers have been used to provide information. Using the information in the last two statements, let us find the time taken for a light ray from the sun to approach earth.

Time =149 600 000 000 ÷ 299 790 000 seconds.

Since there are many digits in each of these numbers, they are lengthy. Therefore more space is required to write them and computations such as the above become difficult. Since a calculator can display only a limited number of characters, it is difficult to do such calculations even with an ordinary calculator. Therefore the need arises to represent such numbers in a more concise way to facilitate calculations.

In this lesson we will learn a method of writing these numbers in a concise way so that it is easy to manipulate them. Let us first do the below given review exercise to recall the facts that have been learnt in previous grades which are relevant to this lesson.

ii. 70 × 10 000 70 × 104

iii. 7 × 100 000 7 × 105

From the above, the last form is used often as it can be easily written and is the most concise form. It is a product of two parts. The first part is 1 or a number between 1 and 10 while the second part is a power of 10.

7 × 105

Number between

1 and 10 or 1

Power of 10

Writing a number with many digits in this manner as a product of two numbers, where one is between 1 and 10 or 1 and the other is a power of 10, is known as the scientific notation.

If A is a number between 1 and 10 or 1 and n is an integer, then A × 10n is a number written in scientific notation (Here 1 ≤ A < 10).

Let us write 280 000 in scientific notation.

Taking the first couple of digits in 280 000 and writing it as a number between 1 and 10 we get 2.8.

∴ 280 000 = 2 80000

= 2.8 × 100 000 = 2.8 × 105 Therefore 280 000 expressed in scientific notation is 2.8 × 105 '

0.01 = 100

1 = 1021 = 10−2

It is clear that,

when writing 0.1 as a power of 10 the index is −1

when writing 0.01 as a power of 10 the index is −2

when writing 0.001 as a power of 10 the index is −3.

0.001 = 1000

1 = 1031 = 10−3

0.75 is a number which is less than 1. When it is written in terms of a number between 1 and 10, it should be written as 7.5 divide by 10. The way this is done mathematically can be expressed as follows.

37for free distribution.

Since 0.75 × 10 = 7.5,

0.75 = 10

7.5

= 1017.5 (Since 10 = 101)

= 7.5 × 10−1 (Since 1011 = 10−1 )

Accordingly, the number 0.75 has been expressed as the product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10.

∴ 0.75 expressed in scientific notation is 7.5 × 10−1 '

In the same manner, let us write 0.0034 in scientific notation.

Since 0.0034 × 1000 = 3.4,

0.0034 = 1000

3.4

= 1033.4

= 3.4 × 10−3

Note: When a number between 0 and 1 is written in scientific notation, the index of the power of 10 is a negative integer.

13.3 Converting numbers expressed in scientific notation to general form

As an example, let us convert the number 5.43 × 104 written in scientific notation to general form.

Method I Method II5.43 × 104 = 5.43 × 10000

= 54 300∴ 5.43 × 104 = 54300

54 30054 300

Since it is multiplied by 104, (that is 10 000) shifting the decimal point 4 places to the right, we obtain 54300.

Another example is given below. This is an instance where the index of the power of 10 is a negative number.

Method I Method II

5.43 × 10−4 = 5.43 × 1041 Since it is divided by 104, shifting the decimal

= 8900 8900. = 0.0089 0.0089

Here for example, 8.9 × 103 can be directly written as 8 900. When multiplying, if the index of the power of 10 is a positive integer, then the decimal point should be shifted to the right, the same number of positions as the index (adding zeros if necessary). When multiplying, if the index of the power of 10 is a nagative integer, then the decimal point should be shifted to the left, the same number of positions as the index.

Rounding off numbers

It is reported that 2 500 people attended the book exhibition held at Sarasvathi hall over the weekend.

- A news item

The number of tickets that were sold over the weekend to those who attended the exhibition mentioned in the news item was 2 4 8 3. Accordingly, the actual number of people who attended the exhibition is 2 483. The number 2 500 which is mentioned in the news item is a number which is close to 2 483, easy to remember and has a special feature. Moreover it is sufficient to communicate an idea of the number that attended the exhibition.

Rounding off a number means representing the value of the number by a value which is close to it, which is simple and, easy to remember and communicate. There are many ways of rounding off numbers. Let us consider a few of them.

41for free distribution.

13.4 Rounding off to the nearest 10

Representing a number by the multiple of 10 which is nearest to it is known as “rounding off to the nearest 10”.

Let us round off 2 483, which is the number of people who attended the exhibition, to the nearest 10. The number 2 483 lies between the two multiples of ten, 2 480 and 2 490. However it is closer to 2 480 than to 2 490. Accordingly, when 2 483 is rounded off to the nearest 10, we obtain 2 480.

We can describe this more generally as follows.

When rounding off 2 481, 2 482, 2 483 and 2 484 to the nearest 10 we obtain 2 480. This is because the multiple of 10 which all these numbers are closest to is 2 480. Similarly, if we round off 2 486, 2 487, 2 488 and 2 489 to the nearest 10 we obtain 2 490. The reason for this is also the same as the above. Even though the remaining number 2 485 is at an equal distance from the two multiples of ten 2 480 and 2 490, when rounding it off to the nearest 10, the convention is to round it off to the nearest 10 which is greater than it, that is, to 2 490. Finally, it is clear that when 2 480 is rounded off to the nearest 10 we obtain 2 480 itself and when 2 490 is rounded off to the nearest 10 we obtain 2 490 itself.

2. The height of the mountain Piduruthalagala is 2 524 m. Round off this

number to the nearest 10.

3. Write every whole number which when rounded off to the nearest 10 is equal

to 140.

4. Write every whole number which when rounded off to the nearest 10 is equal

to 80.

What is the smallest whole number which when rounded off to the nearest 10 is 80? What is the largest whole number which when rounded off to the nearest 10 is 80? 5. When a certain number is rounded off to the nearest 10, the number 260 is

obtained. Find separately the least and the greatest value that this number can take.

“Rounding off to the nearest 100” or “to the nearest 1000” is defined in the same way that “rounding off to the nearest 10” was defined.

For example, the number 7 346 is between the two multiples of hundred, 7 300 and 7 400 and is closer to 7 300 than to 7 400. Therefore when 7 346 is rounded off to the nearest 100, we obtain 7 300. Similarly, if we round off 7 675 to the nearest 100 we obtain 7 700. In general, if we round off a number from 7 300 to 7 349 (both included) to the nearest 100 we obtain 7 300, and if we round off a number from 7 350 to 7 400 (both included) to the nearest 100 we obtain 7 400.

Now, let us consider how to round off numbers to the nearest 1000. For example, when 41 873 is rounded off to the nearest 1000 we obtain 42 000. The reason for this is because 41 873 is closer to 42 000 than to 41 000.

It must be clear to you by this time, what occurs when we round off numbers. Now let us consider a method that can be used to round off numbers easily.

² Let us round off 2 425 to the nearest 100.

2425

The two multiples of 100 between which 2425 lies are 2400 and 2500. The

value of 2425 is less than the value of 2450 which is exactly at the centre between these two multiples of 100. Therefore, 2425 is closer to 2400 than to 2500.

Accordingly, when 2425 is rounded off to the nearest 100 we obtain 2400.

• Let us round off 2485 to the nearest 100.

2485

The two multiples of 100 between which 2485 lies are 2400 and 2500. The

value of 2485 is greater than the value of 2450 which is exactly at the centre between these two multiples of 100. Therefore, 2485 is closer to 2500 than to 2400.

Accordingly, when 2485 is rounded off to the nearest 100 we obtain 2500.

• Let us round off 2450 to the nearest 100.

2450

The two multiples of 100 between which 2450 lies are 2400 and 2500. The

number 2450 is exactly at the centre between these two multiples of 100. According to the convention, the number which is at the centre is rounded off to the nearest multiple of 100 greater than that number.

Accordingly, when 2450 is rounded off to the nearest 100 we obtain 2500.

• Let us round off 2485 to the nearest 1000.

2485

The two multiples of 1000 between which 2485 lies are 2000 and 3000. The

value of 2485 is less than the value of 2500 which is exactly at the centre between these two multiples of 1000. Therefore, 2485 is closer to 2000 than to 3000.

Accordingly, when 2485 is rounded off to the nearest 1000 we obtain 2000.

• Let us round off 2754 to the nearest 1000.

2754

The two multiples of 1000 between which 2754 lies are 2000 and 3000.

The value of 2754 is greater than the value of 2500 which is exactly at the centre between these two multiples of 1000. Therefore, 2754 is closer to 3000 than to 2000.

Accordingly, when 2754 is rounded off to the nearest 1000 we obtain 3000.

• Let us round off 12 500 to the nearest 1000.

12500

The two multiples of 1000 between which 12 500 lies are 12 000 and

13 000. The number 12 500 is exactly at the centre between these two multiples of 1000. According to the convention, the number which is at the centre is rounded off to the nearest multiple of 1000 greater than that number.Accordingly, when 12 500 is rounded off to the nearest 1000 we obtain 13 000.

Rounding off decimal numbers

When the mass of a 5 year old child was measured, it was 12.824 kg. If we write this in grammes, it is 12 824 g. This value was obtained because the scale used for this purpose gives the mass to the nearest gramme. However, for practical purposes

45for free distribution.

the mass is usually required to the nearest kilogramme, to the nearest 10th of a kilogramme or to the nearest 100th of a kilogramme.

It is useful to know how to round off any given decimal number to the nearest whole number, nearest first decimal place, nearest second decimal place, etc. In this lesson we will learn how to round off decimal numbers.

Initially, let us consider how to round off a number with one decimal digit to a whole number. Let us round off 12.7 to the nearest whole number.

1212.112.212.312.412.512.612.712.812.913

centre

The whole numbers on either side of 12.7 are 12 and 13.

Since the numbers 12.1, 12.2, 12.3 and 12.4 are closer to the whole number 12 than to the whole number 13, when these numbers are rounded off to the nearest whole number we obtain 12. Similarly, since the numbers 12.6, 12.7, 12.8 and 12.9 are closer to 13 than to 12, when these numbers are rounded off to the nearest whole number we obtain 13. Furthermore, as in the above sections, 12.5 rounded off to the nearest whole number is accepted by convention to be 13. Accordingly, when 12.7 is rounded off to the nearest whole number we obtain 13.

Similarly,12.3 rounded off to the nearest whole number is 12 and12.5 rounded off to the nearest whole number is 13.

Rounding off to a given decimal place

Round off 3.74 to the nearest first decimal place. In 3.74, the digit in the first decimal place is 7 and the digit in the second decimal place is 4. When rounding off to the first decimal place, the digit in the second decimal place is considered and the digit in the first decimal place is adjusted accordingly if necessary. The rule used here for rounding off is similar to that used in the previous sections. Since the number with one decimal digit which is closest to the numbers 3.71, 3.72, 3.73 and 3.74 is 3.7, when these numbers are rounded off to the first decimal place we obtain 3.7. Similarly when the numbers 3.75, 3.76, 3.77, 3.78 and 3.79 are rounded off to the first decimal place we obtain 3.8. Accordingly, 3.74 rounded off to the first decimal place is 3.7.

46for free distribution.

The rule for rounding off numbers to other decimal places is also the same. Let us consider the following example. Example 2

Round off

i. 3.784 ii. 3.796

to the nearest second decimal place.

When rounding off to the nearest second decimal place, the digit in the third decimal place needs to be considered.

i. 3.784 lies between 3.78 and 3.79. Since 3.784 is closer to 3.78 than to 3.79, when it is rounded off to the nearest second decimal place we obtain 3.78.

ii. 3.796 lies between 3.79 and 3.80. Since 3.796 is closer to 3.80 than to 3.79, when it is rounded off to the nearest second decimal place we obtain 3.80.

Exercise 13.61. Round off each of the following numbers to the nearest whole number and to the

Loci and Constructions14

By studying this lesson you will be able to,

²² identify four basic loci,²² construct a line perpendicular to a given line,²² construct the perpendicular bisector of a straight line segment,²² construct and copy angles,²² solve problems related to loci and constructions.

Loci

A few motions that you can observe in the environment are given below. Let us consider the path of each motion.

1' Cotton floating in the air 2' A bird flying 3' A ball hit by a bat 4' A fruit falling from a tree 5' The tip of a hand of a working watch 6' A child riding a see-saw

You may observe that even though the motions of 1 and 2 are complex and unpredictable, the motions of 3 to 6 have a definite path. It is important to learn about loci in geometry to develop a proper understanding of the paths of the objects undergoing these motions.

A set of points satisfying one or more conditions is known as a locus.

14.1 Basic Loci

Now let us consider four basic loci.

1. The locus of points which are at a constant distance from a fixed point.

Activity 1Step 1: Take a strip of cardboard of length 5 cm,

AOmake two small holes near the two ends and name them O and A.

Step 2: Keep the above strip of cardboard on a

AO

piece of paper, place a pin through the hole O and keep it firm on the piece of paper.

Step 3: Place a pencil point through the hole A and

AO

while holding the pin tightly so that it doesn’t move, move the pencil and mark the path it takes.

Step 4: At the end of the activity, identify the locus that is obtained.

In the above activity, you would have obtained a circular path. Accordingly,

The locus of points on a plane which are at a constant distance from a fixed point is a circle. Example 1

Draw a sketch of the locus of the bottommost point of the bob of a

pendulum in a working pendulum clock.

The locus relevant to this motion is a part of a circle with centre the fixed point of the rod/string to which the bob is connected and radius the distance from this fixed point to the bottommost point of the bob.

2. The locus of points which are equidistant from two fixed points.

Activity 2

Step 1: Draw a straight line segment of length 10 cm on an oil paper/tissue paper and name it AB.

AB

Step 2: Identify the axis of symmetry of the straight line AB by folding the tissue paper such that the two points A and B coincide and mark it with a dashed line.

Step 3: Mark a point P1 on the dashed line, draw the straight lines P1A and P1B, and measure and write their lengths.

Step 4: Mark several more points on the dashed line and measure and write the distances from the points A and B to each of these points.

Step 5: Check whether the distances from the points A and B to each of these points on the dashed line are equal and write your conclusion.

When folding the paper as above, such that A and B coincide, observe that the fold line obtained is perpendicular to AB and that it passes through the midpoint of AB. This line is called the perpendicular bisector of the line segment AB. Observe further that the distances from the points A and B to any point you chose on the perpendicular bisector are equal.

The locus of points which are equidistant from two given points is the perpendicular bisector of the line joining the two points.

It is clear from the above activity that, the locus of a point at a constant distance of 3 cm from the line AB is a straight line parallel to the line AB and at a distance of 3 cm from it. Moreover, two loci can be drawn on either side of AB.

The locus of points which are at a constant distance from a straight line are the two straight lines parallel to it and at the given constant distance from it, on either side of it.

From the above activity it is clear that OX is the line that divides the angle AOB

14.3 Constructing lines perpendicular to a given straight line

Let us explain two phrases that are commonly used in constructions. When drawing a circle using a pair of compasses, phrases such as “taking a certain point as the centre” and “taking a certain length as the radius” are often used. For example, “Taking point A as the centre” means the circle or arc should be drawn with the point of the pair of compasses kept at the point A; and “Taking AB as the radius” means that the distance between the point of the pair of compasses and the pencil point should be equal to the length of AB.

14.5 Construction of angles

By now we have learnt to draw angles using the protractor. However we can construct a few special angles by using a straight edge and a pair of compasses only. Let us recall how we constructed a regular hexagon in grade 8 by using a pair of compasses. Here, taking the length of a side of the regular hexagon which needs to be drawn as the radius, a circle is drawn, and with the same radius, arcs are marked on it.The points at which the arcs intersect the circle are joined to each other and to the centre as shown in the figure.

Then every angle of each equilateral triangle that is formed is 60°.Therefore, AOB

>

= 60o and AOC

= 120o'

Step 2: Taking O as the centre, construct an arc such that it intersects OA as shown in the figure. Name the point of intersection X.

AXO

Step 3: Without changing the length of the radius, and taking X as the centre, draw another arc using the pair of compasses, such that it intersects the first arc. Name this point of intersection Y.

AXO

Step 4: Join the points O and Y and produce it as required. Measure AOY

AX

O

The triangle OXY in the above figure is an equilateral triangle. The reason for this can be explained as follows.

67 for free distribution.

Since OX and OY are radii of the circle with centre O, OX = OY. Similarly, since XO and XY are radii of the circle with centre X, XO = XY.Accordingly, OX = XY = OY.Therefore, OXY is an equilateral triangle.Therefore, every angle of it is 60°.

Therefore XOY

Now, without changing the radius, take Q as the centre and draw another small arc such that it too intersects the first arc and name that point of intersection R.

15.1 Solving linear equations with two types of brackets

You may have observed that there are some equations with brackets in the review exercise. In this lesson we expect to learn how to solve linear equations with two types of brackets. Let us first consider how to construct a linear equation with several brackets and find its solution.

Note: There are several types of brackets that we use. ^ & { } [ ]

Parentheses Curly Brackets Square Brackets

When applying brackets, the usual practice is to first use parentheses, then curly brackets and finally square brackets.

74For free distribution.

“The result of adding three to a certain number and subtracting one from twice this value, and finally multiplying the resulting value by five and adding two is equal to 47”.Let us consider how to construct an equation using the above information and then solve it.

If the number is x, when 3 is added, we obtain x + 3.

Twice this expression can be written as 2(x + 3) using parentheses.

The expression that is obtained when 1 is subtracted from this is 2(x+3) −1.

Using curly brackets to write five times this expression we obtain, 5{2 (x + 3) – 1}

It is given that when 2 is added to this expression it is equal to 47. Therefore,

5{2 (x + 3) – 1} + 2 = 47Now, by solving this equation, let us find the value of the number (x).

First, by simplifying the expression with parentheses we obtain

5{2x + 6 – 1}+ 2 = 47.

When we simplify the expression within curly brackets we obtain,

5{2x + 5} + 2 = 47.Now, simplifying the expression with curly brackets we obtain

10x + 25 + 2 = 47. 10x + 27 = 47

Subtracting 27 from both sides we obtain, 10x + 27 – 27 = 47 – 27.That is, 10x = 20 . Dividing both sides by10 we obtain,

10x

10 = 20

10 x = 2

Therefore, the number is 2.

Let us consider a few more examples of equations with brackets to improve our skills of solving such equations.

Example 1

Solve 2{3 (2x – 1) + 4} = 38'

2{3 (2x – 1) + 4} = 38 (dividing both sides by 2) 2 2 3(2x – 1) + 4 = 19

6x – 3 + 4 = 19 (simplifying the expression with parentheses)

6x + 1 = 19

6x + 1– 1 = 19 – 1 (subtracting 1 from both sides)

6x = 186x

6 = 18

6 (dividing both sides by 6)

x = 3

Example 2

Solve 5{4 (x + 3) – 2 (x – 1)} = 72'

5{4 (x + 3) – 2 (x – 1)} = 72 5{4x + 12 – 2x + 2} = 72 (simplifying the expression with parentheses)

5{2x + 14} = 72

10x + 70 = 72 (simplifying the expression with curly brackets)

10x + 70 – 70 = 72 – 70 (subtracting 70 from both sides)

10x

10 = 2

10 (dividing both sides by 10)

x = 1

15.2 Solving linear equations containing fractions

Now, let us consider how to construct a linear equation with fractions and find its solution.

A vendor bought a stock of mangoes to sell. He discarded 10 fruits which were rotten. The rest he divided into 12 equal piles of 5 mangoes each.

Let us construct an equation using the above data.

If the vender bought x mangoes to sell,when 10 mangoes are discarded, the remaining amount is x – 10.The number of piles that can be made when the remaining mangoes are divided into

groups of 5 is x – 10

5 . It is given that the number of piles is 12.

Therefore, x – 10

5 = 12

Now, let us solve this equation and find x.

x – 10

5 = 12

Multiplying both sides of the equation by 5,

5 x – 10

5 = 12 5

x – 10 = 60

Adding 10 to both sides,

x – 10 +10 = 60 +10 x = 70

Therefore, the vendor bought 70 mangoes to sell.Let us study the following examples to learn more on solving linear equations with fractions.

Example 1

Solve x + 3

2 = 15'

x + 3

2 = 15

You have learnt in previous grades and in the earlier section of this lesson how to find the value of the unknown by solving a linear equation.In this section we will learn how to solve linear equations with two unknowns.

Suppose it is given that the sum of two numbers is 6.

If we take the two numbers as x and y, then we can construct the equation x + y = 6, based on the given statement.Here, x and y are not unique. The following table shows several different pairs of values of x and y which satisfy the above equation.

xyx + y– 176066156246336426516606

Table 1

By observing the above table, we can conclude that there are infinitely many pairs of values of x and y which satisfy the equation x + y = 6.If there is another relationship between x and y, we can construct another equation and by solving both equations simultaneously we can find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations.

79 For free distribution.

Suppose it is given that the difference of the two numbers is 2. If we take the larger number as x, we can construct the equation x – y = 2 , based on the given statement.

There are infinitely many pairs of values of x and y which satisfy this equation too as can be concluded from observing the following table.

xyx – y

6425324223122021–12

Table 2By observing Tables 1 and 2, you can see that there is only one pair of values of x and y which satisfies both x + y = 6 and x – y = 2. This pair is x = 4 and y = 2. Therefore, the solution of the above two equations is x = 4 and y = 2.

A pair of equations of this type with two unknowns is known as a pair of simultaneous equations. “Simultaneous” means “occurring at the same time”. Let us learn how to solve pairs of simultaneous equations using several other methods which are shorter, by considering the following examples.

Example 1

Solve the pair of simultaneous equations x + y = 6 and x – y = 2.

To facilitate finding the solution, let us label the two equations as 1 and 2 'x + y = 6 1 x – y = 2 2

Method I

We can name this method “the method of substitution”.

By making x the subject of equation 2 , we can write it as

x = 2 + y'

By substituting this expression for x in equation 1 we obtain,

2 + y + y = 6.

2 + 2y = 6This is a linear equation in one unknown.

80For free distribution.

Let us find the value of y by solving it.

2 – 2 + 2y = 6 – 2 2y = 4

2y

2 = 4

2 y = 2 We can now find the value of x by substituing y = 2 in x = 2 + y'

x = 2 + 2x = 4

Method IIThis method can be named “the method of elimination”.

x + y = 6 1 x – y = 2 2

First, observe that + y occurs in equation (1) and − y occurs in equation 2 .By adding both equations we getx + y + x – y = 6 + 2

Here we have used the axiom “Quantities which are obtained by adding equal quantities to equal quantities, are equal”.

Now we obtain a linear equation in x, since + y and –y cancel off. Let us solve it and find the value of x.

2x = 8

2x

2= 8

2 x = 4 To find the value of y, let us substitute x = 4 in equation 1 ,

4+ y = 6 4 – 4 + y = 6 – 4 x = 4 y = 2 y = 2 Note that in the above pair of simultaneous equations, the coefficient of y was 1 in one equation and −1 in the other. That is, the numerical values of these coefficients are equal (when the signs are ignored).

81 For free distribution.

Let us consider a few more examples. We will use the 2nd method to solve them.

Example 2

Solve 2m + n = 10 m – n = 2 '

2m + n = 10 1 m – n = 2 2

Adding 1 and 2 , 2m + n + m – n = 10 + 2 3m = 12

3m

3= 12

3 m = 4 By substituting m = 4 in 1 , 2 4 + n = 10 8 + n = 10 n = 10 – 8 m = 4 n = 2 n = 2 Example 3

Solve 2a + b = 7 a + b = 4'

2a + b = 7 1 a + b = 4 2

In these equations, the coefficient of b is equal. Therefore, to eliminate b, we must subtract one equation from the other.

1 – 2 , 2a + b – (a + b) = 7 – 4 (As there is a subtraction, it is essential to use brackets and write (a + b)) 2a + b – a – b = 3

a = 3 By substituting a = 3 in 2 , 3 + b = 4 b = 4 – 3 b = 1

82For free distribution.

Example 4

Solve x + 2y = 11 x – 4y = 5 '

x + 2y = 11 1 x – 4y = 5 2

Here the coefficients of x are equal. Therefore, let us subtract one equation from the other to eliminate x.

1 – 2 , x + 2y – (x – 4y) = 11 – 5 x + 2y – x + 4y = 6

6y = 6

6y

6 = 6

6 y = 1 By substituting y = 1 in 1 , x + 2 1 = 11 x + 2 = 11 x + 2 – 2 = 11 – 2 x = 9

Exercise 15.31. Solve each of the following pairs of simultaneous equations.

a. a + b = 5 b. x + y = 8 c. m + 2n = 7 a – b = 1 2x + y = 2 m – n = 1

d. 4c – b = 7 e. 2a + 3b = 16 f. 3k + 4l = 4 4c – 2b = 2 4a + 3b = 26 3k – 2l = 16

g. x + 3y = 12 h. 3m – 2n = 10 – x + y = 8 – 3m + n = – 14 2. The sum of two numbers is 10 and their difference is 2. Taking the two numbers

as x and y, construct a pair of simultaneous equations and solve them.

3. Two pens and a pencil cost Rs 32. A pen and a pencil cost Rs 20. Taking the price

of a pen as Rs p and the price of a pencil as Rs q,construct a pair of simultaneous equations and by solving the pair find the price of a pen and the price of a pencil.

Formulae17

By studying this lesson you will be able to;

• change the subject of a formula,• find the value of a variable term in a formula when the values of the other variables are given.

Introducing formulae

In grade 8 you learnt Euler’s relationship which is an equation expressing the relationship between the number of edges, number of vertices and number of faces in a solid.

This relationship is the following.

Number of edges = Number of vertices + Number of faces – 2

By taking the number of edges as E, the number of vertices as V and the number of faces as F, this relationship can be expressed as follows.

E = V + F – 2

A relationship between two or more quantities expressed as an equation, is known as a “formula”.

The quantities in a formula are known as variables. In general, a formula is written with just one variable which is called the “subject of the formula” on one side of the equal sign (usually the left hand side), and the remaining variables on the other side. For example, in the formula E = V + F – 2 stated above, E is the subject.

98For free distribution.

Let us consider another formula. Temperature can be expressed in degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit. The relationship between these two units is given below.

F = 9

5 C + 32

Here, F denotes the temperature in Fahrenheit and C denotes the temperature in Celsius. The subject of this formula is F.

Some formulae that are frequently used in Science and Mathematics are given below.

p = 2 (a + b)

v = u + at

s = n

2 (a + l)

y = mx + c

C = 2 πr

A = πr2

17.1 Changing the subject of a formula

E is the subject of the formula E = V + F – 2. If required, we can make either V or F the subject of this formula. This can be done in a manner similar to solving equations by using axioms.

As an example, let us make V the subject of the formula E = V + F– 2. V is on the right hand side of this equation. F and – 2 are also on the same side of the equation as V. To remove the terms F and – 2 from the right hand side, let us add – F and + 2 to both sides of the equation.

We then obtain, E + (–F) + 2 = V + F – 2 + (–F ) + 2 '

Now, by simplifying both sides we obtain,E – F + 2 = V ( since F+ (–F ) = 0 and – 2 + 2 = 0)

The subject V appears on the right hand side.Since the subject is usually written on the left hand side, we re-write the above equation as follows with V on the left hand side.V = E – F + 2 The following examples show how the subject of formulae of various forms are changed.

99For free distribution.

Example 1

Make a the subject of the formula v = u + at '

Here the variable a is multiplied by the variable t. Therefore, we need to first make the term at the subject.Subtracting u from both sides of v = u + at we obtain

v − u = u + at − u v − u = at

Now by dividing both sides by t to make a the subject we obtain,

v − u

t = at

t

By simplifying this we get the formula a = v − u

t with a as the subject.

Example 2 Make n the subject of the formula S = n

2 (a + l) '

S = n

2 (a + l).

Here, the variable n which is to be made the subject is divided by 2 and the result is multiplied by (a + l). Therefore both sides of the formula need to be multiplied by 2 and divided by (a + l) to make n the subject.

By multiplying both sides by 2 we obtain,

2S = 21 n

21 (a + l) 2S = n(a + l)

Now, by dividing both sides by (a + l) we obtain

2Sa + l

= n (a + l)

(a + l)

1

1

2Sa + l = n

n = 2S

a + l

100For free distribution.

Example 3 Make n the subject of the formulal l = a + (n − 1)d'

l = a + (n − 1)dLet us consider the variable n which is to be made the subject. Observe that the right hand side of the formula is formed by subtracting 1 from n to obtain (n − 1), then multiplying (n − 1) by d to obtain (n − 1)d and finally adding a to (n − 1)d.

To make n the subject, we need to perform the inverse operations corresponding to the arithmetic operations performed in the above three steps (i.e., the inverse operation “addition” of the operation “subtraction, the inverse operation “division” of the operation “multiplication”, etc.), starting from the last step and moving up. Expressed in another way, this means that we make n the subject of the formula by using the relevant axioms.

Therefore, let us first subtract a from both sides of the equation and simplify. l = a + (n − 1)d

l − a = a + (n − 1)d − a l − a = (n − 1)d

Now let us divide both sides by d and simplify.

l − a

d

= (n − 1)d

l − a

d= n − 1∴ Finally let us add 1 to both sides and simplify.

l − a

d

+ 1 = n − 1 + 1

+ 1 = n

n = l − a

If required, you may simplify the right hand side further, using a common denominator. However it is not essential to do this.

17.2 Substitution

Suppose that the values of all the variables in a formula except one are given. By substituting these values in the formula, the value of the unknown can be found.

Let us determine the number of edges in a solid with straight edges, which has 6 vertices and 5 faces.

The triangular prism shown above is an example of such a solid.

We can find the number of edges by substituting the values V = 6 and F = 5 in the formula E = V + F – 2.

Substituting V = 6 and F = 5 in the formula we obtain, E = 6 + 5 – 2

= 9

Therefore, the solid has 9 edges.

102For free distribution.

Let us consider more examples.

There are two methods that can be used to find the value of an unknown variable when the values of the remaining variables are given. The first method is to substitute the given values in the formula as it is, and then find the value of the unknown. The second method is to first make the unknown of which the value is to be determined the subject of the formula, and then find its value by substituting the given values. Let us now consider how the value of an unknown in a formula is found using these two methods.

Example 1 Determine the number of vertices there are in a solid that has 7 faces and 12 edges.

We need to use the formula E = V + F – 2 here. The values of F and E are given and we need to find V. We can use either of the above mentioned two methods to find V. That is, we can first substitute the given values in the formula E = V + F – 2 and then find the value of V by solving the resulting equation, or we can first make V the subject of the formula and then substitute the given values and simplify.

Let us consider both methods.Let us take the number of edges as E, the number of vertices as V and the number of faces as F.

Method 1

E = V + F – 2

Substituting E =12 and F = 7 we obtain 12 = V + 7 – 2 12 = V + 5 12 – 5 = V

7 = VV = 7

∴ The number of vertices is 7.

Method 2

First make V the subject of the

formula and then substitute the values.

E = V + F – 2 E + 2 = V + F E + 2 – F = V

V = E + 2 – F V = 12 + 2 – 7 V = 7

∴ The number of vertices is 7.

Note: One reason for changing the subject of a formula is because the value of the unknown can then be found easily by directly substituting the given values.

Measuring the diameter and the circumference of a circle

The total length of the boundary of a circle, or the perimeter of a circle is known as its circumference.

A circular ring made from a metal wire of length 25 cm is shown in the above figure. Since the length of the wire is 25 cm, the perimeter or the circumference of the circle is 25 cm.

We cannot directly determine the diameter of a circle.

Do the following activities to identify different methods of finding the diameter of a circle.

Activity 1

(a) - Measuring the diameter of a circle using a straight edge with a cm/mm scale.

Step1: Draw any circle using the pair of compasses and mark its centre.

Step2: Draw a diameter and measure its length using a straight edge with a cm/mm scale.

(b) - Measuring the diameter by means of an axis of symmetry of a circular lamina.

Step 1: Draw a circle on a piece of paper using an object like a coin or a

bangle and cut it out.

Step 2: Fold the circular lamina into two equal parts (such that the two

parts coincide) and mark the axis of symmetry on it.

Step 3: Since the axis of symmetry is a diameter of the circle, measure

the length of the axis of symmetry and obtain the length of the diameter.

18.1 Measuring the circumference of a circle

Do the following activities in order to find out the methods used to measure the circumference of a circular lamina such as a coin.

Activity 2

1. Mark a point on a piece of thread and with the thread

stretched, place it around the circular lamina until it reaches the initial point that was marked. Mark the final point on the thread when it coincides with the initial point, and measure the length between the two points marked on the thread to find the circumference of the coin.

2. Draw a straight line on a piece of paper.

Keep it on a flat surface. Mark a point on the circumference of the circular lamina and also on the straight line. Place the circular lamina on the straight line such that the two marks coincide and then role it along the straight line until the point marked on the circular lamina touches the line again. The length of the circumference is obtained by measuring the distance the circular lamina has moved along the straight line.

Developing a formula for the circumference of a circle

Compare the values you obtained for c

d in the above activity with the values obtained by your friends and write your conclusion regarding the value of c

d .

Through the above activity you would have obtained a value for c

d which is approximately 3.14 for every object you considered. Mathematicians have discovered that c

d is a constant value for all circles. This constant value is denoted by π. It has been shown that this value is 3.14 to the nearest second decimal and is approximately equal to the fraction 22

7 .

Accordingly,

cd = π .

That is,

c = πd. This is a formula giving the relationship between the circumference and the diameter of a circle. A formula giving the relationship between the radius and the circumference of a circle can be derived as follows.

Since d = 2r we obtain c = π × 2r. i,e.,

c = 2πr

If the circumference of a circle is denoted by c, the diameter by d and the radius by r, then,

c = πd

c = 2πr

18.2 Perimeter of a semicircular lamina

When a circular lamina is separated into two equal

r

parts along a diameter, each part is known as a semicircular lamina (in short, semicircle). The length of the curved line of a semicircle is known as the arc length. It is exactly half the circumference.

Hence, the arc length of a semicircle of radius r = 1

2 × (2πr)

= πr

It is clear from the figure that, to find the perimeter of a semicircle, the diameter should be added to the arc length.

∴ The perimeter of a semicircle = πr + 2r

Right angled triangle

If an angle of a triangle is 90

o, it is called a right angled triangle. The side which is opposite(in front of) the right angle and which is the longest side of the triangle is called the hypotenuse. The other two sides are called the sides which include the right angle.

Draw a right angled triangle PQR with QR = 3 cm and QP = 4 cm. You may use a set square to do this. Measure the hypotenuse PR and verify that it is 5 cm in lenghth. Cut three squares of side length 3 cm, 4 cm and 5 cm and paste them on the sides RQ, QP and PR respectively, as shown in the figure given below.

Now let us calculate the area of each square as shown below.

The area of the square pasted on QR = 3 cm × 3 cm = 9 cm2

The area of the square pasted on QP = 4 cm × 4 cm = 16 cm2

The area of the square pasted on PR = 5 cm × 5cm = 25 cm2

Observe the relationship between the above values as given below.

square on PQ + the area of the

square on PR

Repeat the above activity by taking the lengths of the sides of the triangle which include the right angle as 6 cm and 8 cm to verify the above relationship for these values too.

The Pythagorean relation for a right angled triangle can be expressed as follows.

The area of the square drawn on the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares drawn on the remaining two sides.

Though the Pythagorean relation is shown using areas, we can write it simply in terms of the lengths of the sides of the triangle. Let us see how this is done.

Writing the Pythagorean relation in terms of the lengths of the side

B

A

C

The area of the square drawn on AB = AB × AB = AB2

The area of the square drawn on BC = BC × BC = BC 2

The area of the square drawn on AC = AC × AC = AC 2

Therefore, according to the Pythagorean relation;

AC 2 = AB 2 + BC 2

We can express this as follows too.

The sum of the areas of the squares drawn on the sides BC and BA = ......... cm2 . ∴ The areas of the square drawn on AC is ............ (equal/not equal) to the sum of the areas of the squares drawn on BC and BA.

Now let us consider some problems which can be solved using the Pythagorean relation.

Example 2

Find the horizontal distance from the foot of the wall to the point where the rod is in contact with the ground.

We can draw a rough sketch of this as shown below. Here the wall and the wooden rod are represented by BA and AC respectively.

Applying the Pythagorean relation to the right angled triangle ABC

20.1 Functions

We have come across relationships between different quantities in various situations. Carefully observe the relationship between the two quantities given below.

Let us suppose that beads are sold at 10 rupees per gramme. The prices of different amounts of beads is shown below.

Beeds (g) Price (Rs) 1 1 10 = 10 2 2 10 = 20 3 3 10 = 30 4 4 10 = 40

Accordingly, it is clear that the price of x grammes of beeds is Rs 10x. Moreover, if the price of x grammes of beeds is represented by Rs y, then we can write y = 10x.

Let us take the amount of grammes of beeds as x and the corresponding price as Rs y.

By plotting the price (y) against the amount of grammes of beeds (x) for different values of x using the above relationship, we obtain the following graph.

Exercise 20.1

20.2 Functions of the form y = mx and the gradient of the graph

of such a function

Linear functions such as y = 3x, y = –2x and y = x are examples of functions of the form y = mx. Let us obtain ordered pairs of values of x and y by constructiong a table as follows, to draw the graph of y = 3x for the values of x from –2 to +2. y = 3x

x 3xy (x, y)– 23 –2– 6( –2, – 6)– 13 –1– 3(– 1, – 3)03 00(0, 0)13 13(1, 3)23 26(2, 6)

128For free distribution.

By plotting the above ordered pairs in a coordinate plane, we obtain the graph of the function y = 3x as shown below.

Let us consider some characteristics of the above drawn graph.

² The graph is a straight line ² It passes through the point (0, 0) ² It makes an acute angle counterclockwise with the positive direction of the x - axis

² When any point on the line other than the origin is considered, the value of

y coordinatex coordinate of that point is a constant (a constant value).

For example,

when the point P is considered, y coordinate

x coordinate = 6

2 = 3

when the point Q is considered, y coordinate

x coordinate = – 3

– 1 = 3

Moreover, this constant value is equal to the coefficient m of x of a function of the form y = mx. This constant value is called the gradient of the graph.

129For free distribution.

The gradient can be a positive value or a negative value.

Now, let us explain the behavior of functions of the form y = mx through the activity given below.

Activity 1

1. a. Complete the tables given below for the selected positive values of m to

obtain coordinates of points to draw the graphs of the given functions of the form y = mx, and draw the graphs on one coordinate plane. (i) y = x (ii) y = +3x (iii) y = + 1

b. Complete the tables given below for the selected negative values of m to obtain

coordinates of points to draw the graphs of the given functions of the form y = mx and draw the graphs on one coordinate plane. (i) y = – x (ii) y = – 3x (iii) y = – 1

3 x

x– 202x– 101x– 303y________–2y____0____y1________

Observe the relationship between the angle that a graph makes with the positive direction of the x -axis and the gradient (value of m) by considering the graphs obtained in (a) and (b) above.

By doing the above activity you would have obtained the following graphs.

³ When the gradient (value of m) is positive, the angle that the graph forms counter

clockwise with the positive direction of the x-axis is an acute angle.

130For free distribution.

³ As the value of the gradient increases in the order 1

3 , 1, 3 the magnitude of the angle formed by the graph of the function with the positive direction of the x-axis counterclockwise increases.

(b) Graphs obtained when m is negative

x

y = –3x

y = –xy = –1

³ When the value of the gradient (value of m) is negative, the angle formed with the

positive direction of the x-axis counterclockwise is an obtuse angle.

³ As the value of the gradient (value of m) increases in the order – 3, – 1, – 1

3 the

magnitude of the angle formed by the graph of the function with the positive

direction of the x-axis counterclockwise increases.

The gradient of the graph of the

function y = – x is –1. This means that when the value of x increases by one unit, the value of y decreases by one unit.

The gradient of the graph of the

function y = x is 1. This means that when the value of x increases by one unit, the value of y also increases by one unit.

ii. To find the value of y when x = 2.5,the line x = 2.5,should be drawn (indicated by

the red line) and the y -coordinate of the points of intersection of this line with the two graphs should be obtained.

If we consider the function y = 2x, the value of y is 5 when the value of x is 2.5

If we consider the function y = – 3x, the value of y is – 7.5 when the value of x is 2.5

To find the value of x when y = 3, the line y = 3 should be drawn (indicated by the

green line) and the x - coordinate of the points of intersection of this line with the

two graphs should be obtained.

If we consider the function y = 2x, the value of x is 11

20.3 Graphs of functions of the form y = mx + c and functions given by ax + by = c

Graphs of functions of the form y = mx + c

Let us first consider functions of the form y = mx + c. Let us draw the graph of the function y =3x +1.To do this, let us first develop a lable of values as shown below. y = 3x + 1

y = 3x + 1

By observing the above graph, the following characteristics can be identified.

² It is a straight line graph. ² The straight line intersects the y - axis at (0, 1). ² The straight line makes an acute angle counterclockwise with the positive direction of the x- axis. The value of m of this line is + 3. This means that when the variable x increases by 1 unit, the variable y increases by 3 units. ² The value representing c in the equation y = 3x + 1 is + 1. The y cordinate of

the point at which the straight line intersects the y - axis is also 1. These two values are equal.

The distance, from the origin to the point where the straight line intersects the y - axis is known as the intercept. The intercept of this line is + 1.

Accordingly, the gradient of the graph of a function of the form y = mx + c is m and the intercept is c.

136For free distribution.

Example 1

Prepare a suitable table of values and draw the graph of the function y = x − 2. Using the graph, find the following.

i. The intercept.ii. The value of y when x = 2.5iii. The value of x when y = – 1

Example 2

Without drawing the graph, write the gradient and the intercept of the graph of each of the functions given by the following equations.

i. y = – 2x + 5ii. y + 3x = – 2

137For free distribution.

i. y = – 2x +5 is of the form y = mx + c. Accordingly, the gradient (m) = – 2 The intercept (c) = 5 ii. Let us first write y + 3x = − 2 in the form y = mx + c. That is, y = −3x −2. Accordingly, the gradient (m) = − 3 The intercept (c) = −2

Example 3

Prepare suitable tables for the functions y = 2x, y = 2x + 1 and y = 2x−3, and draw their graphs on the same coordinate plane.

i. Write the gradient and intercept of each graph by observing the equation.ii. Write a special feature that you can observe in the graphs.

y = 2x – 3gradient = 2; intercept = –3

By observing the equations of the graphs it is clear that the gradients of the three graphs are the same.By observing the graphs it can be seen that the lines are all parallel to each other. Therefore, it is clear that if the gradients of two or more linear functions are equal to each other, then their graphs will be parallel straight lines.

Graphs of functions given by equations of the form ax + by = c

Now let us consider the graphs of functions given by equations of the form ax + by = c. It is easy to prepare the table of values by writing this equation in the form y = mx + c.

Consider the following example.

Example 1

Prepare a suitable table of values and plot the graph of the function given by the equation 3x + 2y = 6.

Using the graph that is drawn,

i. write the coordinates of the points at which it intersect the main axes. ii. writethe gradient and intercept.

First let us change this equation to the form y = mx + c

3x + 2y = 6

2y = – 3x + 6

y = – 3

Let us obtain the coordinates of points that lie on the graph of this function from the following table of values and use them to draw the graph.

ii. Gradient (m) = – 3

2, intercept (c) = 3

140For free distribution.

Note(

² Observe that the graph of 3x + 2y = 6 intersects the y axis at the point

(0, 3) and that the y coordinate of that point is equal to the coefficient of x in the equation 3x + 2y = 6.

² Observe that the graph of 3x + 2y = 6 intersects the x axis at the point

(2, 0) and the x coordinate of that point is equal to the coefficient of y in the equation 3x + 2y = 6.

² Note that the graph of 3x + 2y = 6 can be plottted by joining the points

(0, 3) and (2, 0), without preparing a table of values.
