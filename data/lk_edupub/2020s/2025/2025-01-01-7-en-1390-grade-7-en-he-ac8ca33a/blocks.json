Some parents have gone abroad for employment. In such situations the children very often live under the protection of their grand mother, grand father, an uncle or an aunt. We must look into the requirements of the other members of the family who live with us. Each individual differs from another and their thoughts and feelings too are different. Think of an instance when you watched television in your house. When your parents want to watch the news telecast you may have the desire to watch a teledrama on a different channel. If your grandparents are there, they may want to listen to a religious sermon. Above all of them, your younger brother may be wanting to watch a cartoon series on yet another channel. When complicated issues like this arise, you will have to understand the situation when living together under one roof. You will have to understand the wants and desires of everyone in such situations. There can be differences like this, when it comes to preparing food at home. There can be differences with regard to the type of food each one likes and how it should be prepared. If you learn to appreciate such differences from your young age, the bonds and the love towards each",
