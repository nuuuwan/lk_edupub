Central Processing Unit

01

Have you seen the Central Processing Unit?

What is the Central Processing Unit? Where is it located?

Yes, I have.

CPU can't be observed from the outside.

• Computer is like a kitchen in a hotel, and the Central Processing Unit is like a chef in that kitchen.

• As a chef prepares food, the Central Processing Unit processes data in the computer and converts them into information.

• As the food preparation speed depends on the speed of the chef, the speed of the computer depends on the speed of the Central Processing Unit.

• A dual-core processor is like having a kitchen with two chefs preparing two meals, so two things can be prepared at the same time.

1. Computer virus

A computer virus is a main malicious software that gains entry to computer software and files and which is capable of replacating itself and designed to spread from computer to computer through portable devices. It can delete or modify data / information and it can corrupt software as well.

2. Computer worms

It causes damages similar to those of viruses. However, the main difference is that it spreads across computer networks or internet without the support of a host program or any human interaction.

3. Trojan horse

While it seems a useful software at first sight, it will cause damage to the user secretly once he begins to use it.

4. Spyware

It is a malicious software that secretly collects data about a person’s computer usage, internet usage and etc.., and sends them to the relevant party without his knowledge. Data and information too can be provided to the other party secretly through this software.

Damages caused

by malicious

software

Deletion, hiding or modification of data / information.

Creation of new files and folders that do not belong to the user.

Deletion, mal-function or alteration of the software behaviour.

Decrease efficiency of the computer.

Unusual behaviour in computer networks such as sudden disconnection or malfunction of network and the inability to work with the network as usual.

Unusual reduction in the capacity of storage devices

Shutdown the computer or restart again and again.

Possible solutions to

avoid or minimize the harm caused by

malware

Install an antivirus software and update it regularly.

Open an external storage device only after scanning it for possible viruses.

Activate firewall and make right settings.

If using internet, always access secure websites only.

Do not open black listed websites shown by antivirus software.

Do not click on pop-ups that suddenly appear on the screen.

Do not open suspicious emails or attachment.

For daily use, normally maintain a Limited User Account which can allow only a limited number of tasks.

Update all software installed in the computer including the operating system

Use only the original copy of licensed software. Use of pirated software may lead to the spread of malicious software.

Keeping Backups

2

Keeping backups can be defined as a process of keeping copies of software components.

Copies kept as backups can be used in case the original copy is misplaced or damaged. Several storage techniques can be applied to keep backups.

eg: Compact disks (CD) Digital Video Disks (DVD) external hard disks Different location in the same computer (another folder or another drive)

Access Control

3

Providing software solutions for access control

It means the methods and services provided by several software to control access to computer and safeguard its resources.

• Using strong and difficult to guess password• Creation of suitable user accounts• EncryptionBy following the above mentioned methods, not only access to computer can be controlled but also data and information can be protected from sudden loss.

Encryption is another way of protecting data. Encrypted data cannot be read and understood even if it falls into wrong hands. This method is adopted especially when sensitive data is to be communicated.

For free distribution31

Use of physical locks for access control

The computer system, data and information stored in the computers and software are protected by using devices and methods that are in the form of hardware in this method.

For this, following methods are used.

1. Keeping the computer at a secure place.

It is advisable to keep the computer that contains sensitive and valuable data, information at a secure place, so that it will be protected from thieves and unlawful entry of people.

2. Use of CCTV cameras and alarms

Tasks such as monitoring movements when necessary, provision of automatic urgent messages are done by this system.

3. Use biometric passwords

At present, finger prints and voice recognition methods are widely used to access computer systems and to open doors of the computer laboratory.

Unlike a conventional password, using biometric passwords is somewhat a modern method. Permission to access the system is granted only after recognizing authorized person’s identity through finger prints, voice, face or iris.

Numeric Keypad

The numeric keypad is used to enter numbers quickly.

How the keys are arranged in a typical keyboard is shown in Figure 4.1. It is also known as QWERTY keyboard considering the design for alphabets. In some cases, keyboards that are slightly different from this type of keyboard are also available.

Use of Caps Lock key

When the Caps Lock key is pressed once capital letter's are typed. When it is necessary to type normal letters, press the caps lock key again.

• Press Caps Lock key once space , C, D

• Press Caps Lock key again space a, c, d

Use of Shift Key

There are two shift keys on the right and left sides of the keyboard. When letter keys are pressed while keeping the shift key pressed, English capital letters are typed. Similarly when other keys are pressed while keeping the shift key pressed, the symbol on the top of the key is typed.

Space bar – It is used to create an empty space between two words. If pressed once, a single space is created and if pressed twice, two spaces are created and so on. eg:- Pressing once Thank you Pressing twice Thank youTab key – It creates a somewhat big space between two words. Pressing the tab key once creates a single space and pressing it twice creates two spaces and so on.eg: Pressing once Thank you Pressing twice Thank youEnter key – Pressing the enter key once, moves the cursor down to the next line.eg: Pressing once Thankyou

Arrow keys – It moves the cursor up, down, left or right on the screen.Backspace key – When pressed once, it deletes any character, space, number or any other object to the left of the cursor. (cursor’s current position)

Exercise 3 : see Workbook 4.3

Let’s use the Keyboard correctly4.4

As you learned in Grade 6, computer typing can be more successful, when you sit with the correct posture in front of the computer. Improper sitting will cause pain in the hands, neck, back and in other joints.

When sitting for typing, it is essential to keep the body right in front of the space bar of the keyboard. So that, it will enable the user to manipulate all the keys in the keyboard more conveniently.

It is to be noted that while typing on the keyboard, both hands should be raised above the keys of the keyboard. (hands should not touch the keyboard or the table). So that, it will prevent numbness and pain in the fingers. Typing with the habit of resting the palm or wrist on the table may cause prolonged pain or injury in the fingers in the long run.

Normally it is sufficient to press a key softly to type any character, number or symbol. Pressing a key with force is an unwanted action. By doing so, fingers may experience inconveniences and the keys in the keyboard may warn out sooner as well.

While working on the computer, it is essential to give a rest to both hands in circumstances where you are not engaged in typing. In such occasions, both hands can be kept freely on the table or the lap.

Using Sinhala and Tamil Keyboard

Using Sinhala keyboardSinhala keyboards can be seen in two types based on the manner of entering Sinhala letters.

Sinhala keyboard

Standard Sinhala Keyboa rd Phonetics Keyboard

Sinhala characters can be entered to the computer both by character keys located in the keyboard and by phonetics keys too.

• Use of Standard Sinhala Keyboard

In this model, it is essential to remember the location of keys on the keyboard. This Sinhala keyboard is used (operated) in present computers and other data communication devices as well. This model is used in Unicode system too.

Figure 4.3 – Standard Sinhala Keyboard (Wijesekara Sinhala Keyboard)

• Phonetics Keyboard

This is somewhat an easy method and the keyboard can be used according to Sinhala sounds (based on Sinhala sound). Therefore it is not necessary to know the location of the appropriate letters. You can send SMS messages in mobile phone using this method. Therefore, you are already familiar with this method.

Decomposing the Problems 5.1

A problem can be simple or complex according to its nature. It is rather difficult to perceive and understand a complex problem when compared with a simple problem. It is essential to understand a problem thoroughly before going to solve it. So it will be easier to find a solution to a complex problem after decomposing it into smaller sub-problems.

Decomposition according to shape

Decomposition according to background colour A complex object (figure) with several shapes and colours

Figure 5.1 - Decomposition of a complex object

Likewise, a complex problem that seems difficult to solve at once can be broken into several smaller sub-problems as much as possible. Then these sub-problems can be solved easily one by one.

Advantages of decomposing a problems

• Easy to solve• Easy to understant• Easy to describe• Easy to analyze

eg:- In grade o6, you have learnt about the basic mathematical function which include addition, substraction, multiplication and division of a whole number. Additionally in the first term of graded 07, you have learnt about solving sums when more than one mathematical functions are used with a whole number.Consider the following sum (Refer Figure 5.3).

Solution17

Since it is hard and complicated to solve this sum at once (in one step), it would be simple and easy to find a solution after decomposing the sum into three sub-problems as multiplication, addition and division involved in the sum. The final solution can be reached easily by logically integrating the answers obtained in each sub-problem.

Activity 4 : See Workbook 5.4

Selection 5.2.2

Here it is expected to make a making decision on which step to follow depending on the condition given by the algorithm. In a selection, the condition is checked first and the flow direction is chosen based on whether the condition is true or false.

For example, let's consider an instance where a ceiling fan is operated. When the switch is on, the ceiling fan operates if there is power. If there is no power, the ceiling fan does not operate.

Repetition 5.2.3

Execution of an instruction or several instructions in an algorithm repeatedly until a condition is satisfied is called repetition. A repetition will take place depending on whether a condition is satisfied or not satisfied. For example, natural water cycle is a process that takes place repeatedly.

As an example, do you know that since your childhood, you used to save moneyby using a till to put money? The one who is used to save money in a till, will always put money (again and again) repeatedly until the till fills.So, here the process of putting money is repeated until the condition that is ‘till becomes full’ is satisfied.

Use of a variable5.4

In programming, variables are used to store a value in memory temporarily. Let’s study the following activity to understand the nature of a variable.

Let’s consider a situation where two types of coloured liquid have been poured into two separate glass vessels.

A vessel B vessel

Now let’s consider changing liquid in A vessel into B vessel and liquid in B vessel into A vessel.

For free distribution61

In this way, in order to change the liquid from one vessel to the other, it is necessary to have an extra vessel.Let’s name that vessel as C vessel.

C vessel

step 1 : Changing liquid in A vessel to C vessel

A vessel B vesselC vessel

step 2 : Changing liquid in B vessel to A vessel

A vessel B vesselC vessel

step 3 : Changing liquid in C vessel to B vessel

A vessel B vesselC vessel

As a vessel can store liquid, so a variable can store a value. The above vessels named as A, B and C can be considered as variables and the liquid poured into them can be considered as values of the variables.

Bugs5.4.2

Bugs may occur when developing a programme. Errors in a programme are called bugs, while the elimination of such bugs is called debug. In such a situation, unexpected problems are to be faced when a program with bugs run. Programmes with bugs may not run properly. Therefore before running a programme, bugs that may occur in that program should be eliminated.

Elimination of Bugs

Bugs may occur in such situations as change of order in the instructions (block), omission of instructions (block) or non-mentioning of correct variables and their values. Bugs in a programme can be eliminated by correcting bugs in the instructions(block) or arranging the order of the instructions (block) sequentially.

Let’s compare the following programme with bugs and the programme without bugs developed to draw a rectangle with length and width 200 and 100 respectively.

The above programme on the left has been developed to draw a rectangle. However the expected output cannot be achieved due to bugs in the programme. Therefore there is a possibility to get an erroneous output. It is proved by the programme on the right that a correct output can be achieved after eliminating those bugs.

A program with bugs may not run properly. After eliminating the bugs, the programme can run properly.

³ Program development can be made easy by decomposing a complex problem

³ There are three control structures used to develop a programme. They are sequence, selection and repetition.

³ Execution of instructions (sequentially) step by step in an algorithm is called sequence.

³ Making decision as to which step to follow based on the condition given by the algorithm is called selection.

³ Flow direction in a flow chart is determined based on the condition of the flow chart.

³ Scratch open source programme can be used for visual programme development.

³ Command blocks are used in the development of Scratch program

³ Following command blocks can be used to display the decision ² The block to be used to show steps to follow only if the condition becomes true

² The block to be used to show steps to follow if the condition becomes true or not

³ In programming, variable is used to store value in memory.
