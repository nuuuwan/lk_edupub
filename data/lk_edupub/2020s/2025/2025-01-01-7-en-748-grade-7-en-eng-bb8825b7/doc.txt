Prevention is Better than Cure

Animals help to keep the balance in nature. At the same time, animals could pose health hazards to people. We have to be aware of these dangers to prevent them. Household pets like dogs and cats can transmit a disease called “rabies” to people. This disease is very dangerous because it has no cure. Pets should be vaccinated against this disease. We can take our dogs to free vaccination camps and get them vaccinated. We must also keep pets like cats clean and healthy. Parasites like ticks and fleas can make both people and animals ill.

There are many insects living around us that are harmful to our health. Mosquitoes spread diseases like dengue and malaria. Destroying mosquito breeding grounds is the best prevention method. Houseflies contaminate food and cause food poisoning and diarrhoea. They also spread diseases like typhoid. We can get rid of flies by keeping our homes and surroundings clean.

Insects like bees and wasps sometimes sting people. It is best to see a doctor because some people develop allergic reactions due to the venom that is injected by the sting.

e.g. :-

Moths are insects that look similar to butterflies. They have two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs. But their wings are smaller than those of butterflies. Their bodies are also thicker. Baby moths look like worms and are called larvae. Larvae are considered pests because they destroy clothes.
