What is a number system?

A number system is a method that can be used to represent numbers. There are several different number systems. Each number system has a fixed number of different symbols.

Types of number systems1.2

The base of the number system determines to which number system a given number belongs to :

We will learn about four different number systems. The following table shows the symbols and the base of each number system. The number of different symbols in a given number systems is the Base of that number system.

Number systemSymbolsBaseBinary 0,1 2Octal 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 78 Decimal 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 910Hexadecimal (Hex)0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F16

Note - Only binary and decimal number systems are studied in Grade 8.

The base of a number system 1.3

The base indicates to which number system a given number belongs to. The base is shown at the right end of the number as a subscripted text.e.g. - binary number system - 1012 , 1110112 octal number system - 1018 , 5738 decimal number system - 10110 , 4710 hexadecimal number system - 10116 , 7B16

Refer to workbook for Activity 1.1.

Decimal number system1.4 Humans are familiar with the decimal number system. We identify the symbols here as numbers. We use the decimal number system for all arithmetic operations.

Symbols in decimal number system - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Each position in a given number has a place value.

e.g.- Shown below are examples using symbols 1, 2, 3 :

The necessity of converting one number system to another1.6

All input fed into the computer exist in the binary form. Subsequently, the data in the binary form in the computer is processed and the output is information in the form of text, image, sound, video, etc.

For example, if a user feeds a decimal number into the computer via keyboard, it is represented in binary form inside the computer.

Therefore, conversion from one number system to another is important.

1.6.1Converting decimal numbers to binary numbers

In order to convert a decimal number to a binary number, the decimal number is repeatedly divided by two until the remainder is 0 and the remainder of the division can be written on the right side. After that, write all the remainders from the bottom to top to represent the decimal number in binary form. However, the number is displayed on the display screen as a decimal number.

Binary representation of data and instructions on computers1.7

The computer uses ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ states to represent data and instructions as a bit pattern of 1s and 0s.

Texts, sounds and images are stored in the computer memory as binary bit patterns. Hence, all data need to be converted into binary form before processing.

e.g. -

Data seen by humans Data seen by the computer

1010...10101011...11010101........................

11..1100101.0010111...0101........................

Conversion from binary form back to text, images and soundsOutput

All processes in a computer are performed using 0 (OFF) and 1 (ON) states. Data are fed to the memory of the computer in binary form. The binary data are sent to the processor and then sent back to the memory after processing. Subsequently, they are sent to the output devices. Figure 1.5 illustrates the flow of binary data among the different components of a computer system.

Formatting date, time zone, currency and numbers 2.1

The currency in my

computer is dollar.

Can I change it to

rupees?

There is a time difference between my watch and the computer. I changed the time in the computer yesterday too.

It has changed again today.

The computer operating system has the solution to both problems. We only have

to format time and currency

as required.

It is important to format the date, time zone, time, currency and number to suit the country where the computer is used.

2.1.1The date, the time zone and time in a computer

Format is useful in :

²²Installing and updating software

²²Working with application software, in scheduling to activate, shut down and updating.

²²Updating the operating system software

²²Activating software licenses

The importance of setting up the date, the time zone and time in a

computer

Date and time of a computer

It is important to have the correct date and time in a computer and maintain them, because file saving, searching, sending reminders, preparation of business letters, etc. use date and time of the computer.

Time zone of a computer

The countries in the world are divided into different time zones and they maintain a unique time according to an international standard. These time zones are used for legal, commercial and social purposes.

e.g. - 6.00 am in Sri Lanka will be 1.30 am in United Kingdom

13For free distribution

Currency and its formats

The default currency setting of a computer is the currency of the country of which the operating system is produced.

Therefore, we need to modify the currency to suit our country.

Number formats

Absence of a currency and number formats to suit international acceptance, could be a drawback when working with the Internet.

Refer to workbook for Activity 2.1.

Advantages of file permission attributes

²²File permission attributes provide important details regarding the file. Changing file rights can also help with the following;

◦◦The file can be made hidden.

◦◦As a file protection strategy, others may see the file, but it can be converted to a read only file which does not allow for modification.

Refer to workbook for Activity 2.2.

2.1.3Searching files

Files are searched when the name of file or the place stored in, is unknown.

Several search methods are provided by an operating system. Files can be search by file name, file extension or date saved.

File extension can be used to search files by type. Using this, let us search for a file.

Problems related to operating

system

Figure 2.4 : Software problems

Application software

Application software is a computer program that is designed to perform specific tasks.e.g. - Word processing software (e.g. - MS Word) Spreadsheet software (e.g. - MS Excel) Web browser (e.g. - Firefox, Chrome) Image editing software (e.g. - Paint)

Troubleshooting application software problems

The following some example for application software problems;

²²Does not run²²No response, even though it is open²²Inability to see the interface²²Takes long time to load and is slow²²Does not respond to user commands²²Indicates incorrect functioning

Solution 01 :

The simplest solution is to close the application software and reopen. If this does not work, follow the below steps.

Solution 02 :

Find out if the software is compatible with the specification of the computer and with the installed operating system. Software compatibility is the feature of software components or systems which allows to function together. A software

29For free distribution

which is compatible with one computer environment may not be compatible to another. For instance, some software that are compatible with Windows operating system do not work with Mac operating system. Therefore, check whether the software is compatible with the computer's operating system. If software is compatible go to the next step.

Solution 03 :

Check whether the software is licensed. Further, check whether the trial period of software is expired. Unlicensed software or software with expired trial period can cause problems. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

Solution 04 :

Try 'Repair' option of the application software. Restart the computer and reopen the application software.

Solution 05 :

Uninstall the problematic software from the computer and reinstall the same software. You will need assistance from the teacher for the 4th and 5th solutions.

Problem : The above problems of application software may be resolved easily. Sometimes, such problems can occur due of viruses. Let us see how to resolve such problems.

Solution :

Scan the computer using an antivirus software. Restart the computer and the application software.

Note - Computer virus is a malicious code which harms the computer

system, destroys data and has the ability to replicate itself.

Problems in operating system

Problem analysis4.1

Analyzing a problem involves dividing the problem into smaller segments of the problem and examine. This will make it easier to solve the problem.

For example, let us consider an invoice issued by a stationery shop.

Invoice ABC Bookshop Date - ''''''''''''''''''''

ItemAmountUnit price Price

Carbon pens3 15.00 45.00

Total415.00

InputOutputs

process

To calculate the price (amount) of each item, number of items and unit price are required. The items required to prepare the invoice, are called input. Calculating the total price for each item and the value of total bill is known as processing. Price (amount) for each item and total bill value are known as output.

Hence, let us analyze the above bill and identify input, process and output.

Input : Item description, number of items, unit price

Process : For an item purchased;

Amount = number of items × unit price

Total bill = total price (amount) of all items purchased

Output : Amount to be paid

In order to develop a computer program, it is essential to identify the inputs, process and outputs by analyzing a problem. (see figure 4.1)

control structures

A control structure is a block in a program that analyses variables and chooses a direction of flow of the program.

You have learnt in chapter five of Grade 7 book that there are three types of control structures as sequence, selection and repetition.

Note - In inputs and outputs are denoted by the symbol and the processes are by symbol.

4.2.1Sequence

If the steps are carried out one after the other from the beginning to the end in a particular consecutive order, it is called a sequence.

The flowchart and the Scratch program below is equivalent to the Example 2 in page 40.

Selection decides which step(s) are executed depending on whether a condition of an algorithm is satisfied or not. For example, consider a rainy day. If it rains students are asked to go to the library. If it does not rain, students are asked to go to the playground. The decision box in flowcharts, is used to show the selection control structure (See Figure 4.3). If the condition is true, it is directed towards ''Yes''. If it is false, it is directed towards ''No''. The following symbol is used To indicate the decision making;

There are three basic logic gates as AND, OR and NOT.

AND Gate

Let us consider the following analogy to understand function of the AND gate.

Table 5.2 : Indicating water supply by 0 and 1

A valve B valveWater supply to tank000010100111

The table above indicates whether the valves supply water or not. Similarly, the AND gate decides whether an electric signal is present or not. Availability of an electric signal is shown by state ''1'' and the unavailability is by state ''0''.

In order to obtain the output 1, both inputs should be 1 in an AND gate.

OR Gate

Let us consider the following analogy to understand the function of the OR gate. As shown in the illustration below, the house has a water tank in addition to the regular main water supply. The tank is to ensure uninterrupted water supply. There are two valves A and B. (See Figure 5.2)

Note - Logic Gates

1. The basis building block of Central Processing Unit (CPU) and other

electronic devices and computers are logic gates. The basic function of the CPU uses logic gates.

2. Digital signals are used in digital computers. The significance of

digital signals is that it has one value out of two, at a particular point in time (See Figure 1).

Figure 1 : Digital signal

3. Logic gates take digital inputs and provides digital outputs. The digital

inputs and outputs take binary values. That means, the input and output are available only in one form of two states as 0 or 1.

4. Binary values can be represented using different methods. The most

common method of representing is 0 and 1. They can also be shown represented as TRUE/ FALSE or HIGH/ LOW. In computer hardware, they are voltage values with 5V and 0V (See table 1).

Table 1 : Methods of representably binary values

10HIGHLOWTrueFalse5 V (volt)0 V

5. Computer uses AND, OR and NOT logic gates to process data. Logic

gates take states 0 or1 as input and produce 0 or 1 states as output.
