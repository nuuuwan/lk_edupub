Foreword

You are born in a country, which is renowned as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. Even though your country appeared to be small when compared to other countries, its worth is incomparable. You who are born in such a treasured and estimable country are truly fortunate. It is our sole expectation that as students, you would enlighten the future world by educating yourselves well and by becoming virtuous citizens. In order to help realize that expectation, the government takes all necessary measures to provide all the facilities free of charge. This textbook is offered to you as one step of that process.

According to the primary curriculum, new textbooks for grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 have already been introduced. Following the introduction of new textbooks for grade 5 in 2020, the revision of the primary curriculum will be concluded. There are about 30 textbooks offered by the government to students studying in grades 1 to 5. It’s your responsibility to strive towards enlightening your life through the usage of this treasure.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial and writer boards as well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department who have strived to offer this textbook to you.
