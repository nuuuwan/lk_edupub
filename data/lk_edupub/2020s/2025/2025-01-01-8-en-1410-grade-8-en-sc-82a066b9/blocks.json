It is said that in Athens of Greece, a public debate was held between the proponents of Aristotle and Democritus. The idea that \"matter is particulate in nature\" became victorious at that debate and later modern scientists confirmed experimentally the fact that matter is made up of particles. The status matter exists as a collection of particles with spaces among them is known as discontinuous nature or particulate nature of matter.",

Even at the moment when the volume becomes extremely small after repeated divisions, water is the substance which occupies that volume. In such a way, the smallest volume of water that can be obtained while retaining the properties of water can be called a water particle.

    "text": "When water is heated temperature rises gradually. At a certain moment, the rise in temperature stops and water turns into the vapour state from the liquid state. That temperature remains unchanged till all the water is vapourised. That temperature is called the boiling point of water. The boiling point of pure water at standard atmospheric pressure is 100 oC (The boiling point of a liquid depends on the surrouding pressure. If the surrounding pressure falls, the boiling point falls. The boiling point of water on a high mountain is lower than 100 oC).If water is not pure due to the dissolving of foreign substances the boiling point (100 oC) may be elevated or lowered. From this it is clear that the boiling point is also a physical characteristic that can be used to probe the purity of a compound.Table 4.10 shows boiling points of some substances under normal atmospheric pressure.Table 4.10",

It can be done by striking with a metal rod or dropping on the cement floor from a suitable height.To inquire into the thermal conductivity a change that can be observed during the transmission of heat has to be used.

    "text": "\u00b2Terminals of a magnet, where magnetic force is concentrated are called magnetic poles. \u00b2There is a magnetic field on the earth. It is known as geomagnetism. When a compass is placed near the earth the direction that its pointer indicates is the direction of earth's magnetic field. \u00b2The direction indicated by the compass is the magnetic north. It lies a little north-western to the real north. \u00b2Permanent magnets are made of steel and ferrite, and temporary magnets are made of soft iron. \u00b2Contact method and electrical method are used to make permanent magnets. \u00b2Power of a magnet may wear off with time, because of high temperature, strong vibrations and the influence of strong magnetic fields. \u00b2Power of a magnet can be retained for a long time by proper storage. \u00b2Permanent magnets and electromagnets are widely used in day-to-day life.",
