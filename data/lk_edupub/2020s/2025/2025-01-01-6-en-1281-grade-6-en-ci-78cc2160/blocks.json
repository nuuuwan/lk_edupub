I remembered the day when I, as a child like you, was admitted to this school. As my parents told me, this school had been started in 1935 as a government school. That was for the children of the village who found it difficult to go to the school in the city. Those days, there were only two schools in the city. One was a missionary school. The other was a Buddhist school. There were not many families in the village. There were only about twenty families residing here. Most of the people in the village were farmers by occupation. There were potters also. My father was a businessman.There were carters and chena cultivators. There were also children who did not attend school, in the village. The children of the rich people of the village went to the schools in the city. But it was not that easy to go to the city as now. It took quite a long time to get to the city along the gravel road, by buggy cart. Most people walked to the city. This school was first started by Mr. M.A. Bandara, on a small block of land at the end of the bazaar that belonged to my father. It was a small cadjan thatched, wattle and daub room. The teacher was Mr. Sekara Vidanarachchi. After leaving a little space for the staff room, the rest was used for the school. I was the first student to be admitted. Afterwards, about fourteen students were admitted to the school, from time to time. The small building in the distance was where the school was located at first.",

It was only after that we got large buildings, laboratory and other facilities. ''Not only children of the village, clever children from neighbouring areas too came to this school for further education. I too entered university. The school produced academics and professionals who rendered an effective service to the country. On completion of my university education, I was appointed to this same school as a teacher.'' ''On the first day, I assumed duties, the principal introduced me at the morning assembly as a brilliant student of this school. Later, I became the principal of the school. The school today is more developed than it was at our time. It will improve further in future. My request to all of you is to be one like me, who can speak with pride about your school\" saying this Mr. Appuhamy concluded his speech. All the students applauded with pleasure. On the following day, during the Citizenship Education period the students discussed with the teacher what they had learned from Mr. Appuhamy. The teacher's view was that further information could be gathered from the documents available in the school. The documents were examined, with the permission of the principal. Much of the facts available were correct. The students felt really proud of their school.",

    "text": "Christopher William Wijekoon Kannangara was born on the 13th of October 1884 in the village of Randomba situated between Balapitiya and Ambalangoda. He lost his mother, at the age of six, but his step-mother treated him well. Showing many talents in his childhood, he got his primary education from Randombe Wesley Missionary School. At a prize giving of the school, little Kannangara received many prizes from the chief guest, Rev. J. H. Darel, the principal of Richmond College. When C.W.W. Kannangara was 14 years old he won a scholarship to Richmond College. He received free board and lodging with facilities for education. Being quite satisfied with these facilities he focused his attention completely on studies, utilizing the facilities to the maximum. He never expected special privileges. It might have been because of the tough experiences that he had to face during his schooling that made up his mind to bring relief to the under privileged children of Sri Lanka. Being a very clever student, he scored the highest marks in Mathematics at the Cambridge Senior Examination of 1903. He was the leader of the school cricket team and a member of the football team. He was famous as a talented debater and an actor at school. He served as a teacher at the Richmond college. Serving as a teacher at Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa and Wesley College, he studied law. He joined the legal profession in 1910. While practising as a lawyer he was involved in social work and politics. In 1923 he became a member of the State Council representing the Galle District. In 1931 C.W.W.Kannangara was reelected as a member of the State Legislative Council and he was the president of Sri Lanka Jathika Sangamaya as well.",

    "text": "The story of a child who made a habit of telling liesIn a certain village there was a child who herded cattle. This boy who made telling lies a habit took his herd to a lawn in the middle of a forest for grazing. One day he began to scream.....\"Oh the tiger is here, please save me.\" Some people who were cutting firewood in the forest, ran to the place where the child was screaming. Then the boy stopped screaming and laugh sarcastically, He said, \"Oh! You got fooled, hoo, hoo, you got fooled!\"A few days later, this child began to scream as on the previous day from the middle of the forest,\" screaming the tiger is here, please save me!... That day too the people who heard him came running and realized that they had been fooled once again. They felt ashamed. On another day, when this boy was grazing the cattle a tiger actually came towards him, growling.The child continued to scream.....\" the tiger has come, .....oh save me.\" Although the men who had come to the forest heard this cry they did not pay much heed nor did they go towards where the cry came from. Next day the people of the village came to know that the boy who went to herd the cattle had actually been attacked by the tiger.The one who tells lies cannot be believed even when he is telling the truth.",

We were able to identify the physical resources and how they can be used in the social and economic needs and how to economize them. Human resource is the most precious resource and it can be divided as intellectual and physical abilities. We can develop its quality through training. The economic affairs in the region can be divided into agricultural affairs, industrial affairs and services. Most of the time, these affairs are based on the human and physical resources of the region. Co-operative living of the people in a particular area contribute to the advancement of both region and the family. There are many examples of such occasions, where the work becomes easy resulting in many advantages. There are many individual and group organizations which support the people. Religious institutions, public institutions and provincial councils are very important. Government officers and many others have been involved into that network. Many needs of the area are fulfilled by this. These institutions and people help the general public in the social and economic affairs and spiritual development. Apart from these institutions various associations and committees also help the people in their needs. The institutions and the individuals who receive the services should perform their duties. By studying this chapter you can understand that through inter relationship we can expect the development of individuals as well as society.",

Similarly you have to associate with various types of people at home as well as in society. Think about the people you associate with. Remember how you got to know each other. You may have asked their name, village, age, siblings and many more details and vice versa. You may remember how you talked to them using very pleasant words. It is possible that the good relationship between you and them would have been based on those polite and pleasant words. If you had not used such words, there would not be such a good relationship. If it is so, you would have only a few friends. To be a good friend among friends and to win the hearts of your family members as a virtuous individual, you should practice polite language.",

It was reported that the, only child of a particular family had lost his life due to this fatal accident. Many children became helpless with the death of their parents. People who lost their lives and became disabled are precious lives of our country. This shows how the minute act of one person affects the whole society in different ways. Good behaviour of every single person is needed very much for the well-being of the whole society.What is discipline and good-behavior?Discipline means acting according to social standards and following the rules and regulations of society.Well-behaviour is also all about the discipline of a person. It means behaving according to the rules and regulations, constitutions and customs.

Let us preserve the local identity with pride.The following ideas are from the Television discussion held on the topic \u201cOur motherland.\u201d \u201cSri Lanka is a wonderful country. Our country has a range of climates that we can find all over the world except snow. The crops that grow in any cold country, can be cultivated in Nuwara Eliya. Areas like Jaffna and Mannar, have a warm climate. The other areas have an intermediate climate. There are rivers, water streams, tanks, ponds and also lots of waterfalls in our country.\u201d \u201cIn America we cannot find a single green coloured tree until we move 30 kilometers out of New York City. The trees over there also remain green only for half a year. They do not have a sunny day time throughout the year. They cannot believe their eyes when they see our country full of green.\u201d \u201cIn some other countries human beings and animals die due to the excessive heat and unbearable cold. But in our country we do not find such unbearable cold or heat. Our climate does not cause harm, but is conducive to life.\u201d \u201cWe have banana, papaw, grapes and all the other fruits right throughout the year. Coconut and areca nut are abundant throughout the year. Every moment we hear sweet songs of birds. We cultivate cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, coconut, rubber, cocoa, pepper and betel right through the year. Every forest is a store of medicine. We have inherited a golden land of gems, graphite, ilmenite, phosphate and many other mineral resources. As such we can proudly say that we are born to a prosperous country.\u201d Our ancestors have created many things. These creations have been admired as remarkable creations by the whole world, despite the development of modern technology. After the discussion a song composed by Mahagama Sekara and sung by Visharada W.D.Amaradeva was played and some visuals related to that song were telecast.",
