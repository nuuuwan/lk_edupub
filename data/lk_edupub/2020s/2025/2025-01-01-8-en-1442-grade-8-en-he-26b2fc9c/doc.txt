Our achievements and other positive characteristics can improve the self esteem of others too. As we discussed previously, Nimalâ€™s family, friends, teachers, schoolmates and people in his area would have been all happy when he won the 100 meters gold medal.

When Susanthika Jayasinghe won the Olympic silver medal and when Sri Lanka won the world cup in cricket the whole country felt proud and happy regarding the achievements of our sportspersons.

As we improve our self-esteem, we should also think of the self-esteem of others too. Further, we should make it a point not to do anything that could damage othersâ€™ self esteem.

We can also make our contribution towards boosting the self-esteem of our younger brothers and younger sisters, friends and workers employed at school or in our house.

People with good self esteem contribute positively to the society. Those with high self esteem must be conscious of the self esteem of others and            #     esteem of others as well as of themselves.

Each person is unique. We have different characteristics and abilities. Therefore, we must appreciate the positive aspects of each person.

For example a doctor will cure patients while a farmer will provide food for people.

Standing start

Standing start is called so because, this start is taken being in a standing position. The standing start is used for medium-distance and long-distance races. Accordingly, the standing start should be used for all the races above 400 metres.

eg: 800 metres 1,500 metres 5,000 metres 10,000 metres

Two commands are given for the standing start. 1. on your marks2. go (a signal or the sound of starting gun)

When taking the standing start, you should get ready as shown in the  $%

Crouched start is used for sprints.

It is compulsory that the crouched start is used upto and including 400-metres races

eg: 100 m 200 m 100 m X 4 relay race 400 m X 4 relay race 100 m hurdles 110 m hurdles 400 m hurdles.

Three commands are given for the crouched start:1. on your marks2. get set3. go (a signal or sound of starting gun)

In the crouched start, the way the legs are placed, changes according to the height of the runner. Accordingly, the crouched start is divided into three categories, namely the bullet start, medium start and the elongated start. Shown below is how the legs are placed in the medium start.

Medium start is taken being in a kneeling position.The three phases in the medium start should be performed as follows:

In the medium start, the runner should immediately stand up at the signal given at the â€˜goâ€™ phase and running should be started.

Sprinters should practice how to perform this quickly.
