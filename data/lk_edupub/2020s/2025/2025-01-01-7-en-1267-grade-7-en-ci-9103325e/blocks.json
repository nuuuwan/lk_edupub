Thereafter the song composed by Ananda Samarakon \"Namo Namo Matha\" was sung as the National Anthem in the second independence day celebrations. On the 22nd of November 1951 the cabinet decided this song should become the National Anthem. Later the first sentence was changed as Sri Lanka Matha instead of Namo Namo Matha.",
