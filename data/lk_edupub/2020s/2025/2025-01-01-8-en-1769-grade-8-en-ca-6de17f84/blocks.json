And as he stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons; for a long time he had worn no clothes, and he lived not in a house but among the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, \"What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech you, do not torment me.\" For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him; he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters, but he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the desert.) Jesus then asked him, \"What is your name?\" And he said, \"Legion\"; for many demons had entered him. And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss. Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them leave. Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country. Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. And those who had seen it told them how he who had been possessed with demons was healed. (Luke 8:26-36)",

As he went, the people pressed round him. While he was still speaking, a man from the ruler's house came and said, \"Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.\" But Jesus on hearing this answered him, \"Do not fear; only believe, and she shall be well.\" And when he came to the house, he permitted no one to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child. And all were weeping and bewailing her; but he said, \"Do not weep; for she is not dead but sleeping.\" And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. But taking her by the hand he called, saying, \"Child, arise.\" And her spirit returned, and she got up at once; and he directed that something should be given her to eat. And her parents were amazed; but he charged them to tell no one what had happened. (Luke 8:40-42, 8:49-56)",

And he said to his disciples, \"Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.\" And they did so, and made them all sit down. And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd. And all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over, twelve baskets of broken pieces. (Luke 9:10-17)",
