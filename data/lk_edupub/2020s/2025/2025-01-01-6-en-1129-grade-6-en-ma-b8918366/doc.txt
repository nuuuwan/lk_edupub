2 Place Value

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,

● know the place value corresponding to the position of each digit in a whole number,● know the value represented by each digit in a whole number and ● read and write in words numbers up to the billions period.

2.1 Place value

When writing numbers, we most often use the Hindu-Arabic number system. In this system, the ten digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are used to write numbers.

When writing numbers from zero up to nine, we write one digit in one position. As an example, the number three is written as 3 using a digit. That is, one position is used to write 3. The greatest number which can be written using only one position is 9.

The number which is one greater than nine is ten. Each number from ten up to ninety nine is written using either two distinct digits or one digit twice using two positions.

As an example, the number ten is written as 10 using digits. The number ninety nine is written as 99 using digits. That is, the numbers 10 and 99 are written using two positions.

Now, let us consider a couple of numbers written using the digits 3 and 5 in two positions.

When the digits 3 and 5 are written as 35, the number is “thirty five”.When the digits 3 and 5 are written as 53, the number is “fifty three”.

That is, the numbers obtained are different to each other according to the positions of the digits 3 and 5.

For free distribution9

Now, let us describe the place value corresponding to the position of each digit in a number and the value represented by each of the digits.

● Using thirty five beads, if chains containing ten beads each are made by threading the beads, there will be three chains of ten beads each, with five beads remaining.

3 tens 5 onesThe thirty five beads can be separated into three sets of ten beads each and five sets of one bead each. That is, Thirty five = 3 tens + 5 ones = 35

According to the above explanation, the 5 in 35 represents 5 ones. The position which 5 occupies is the 'ones place'. The place value of the position occupied by the digit 5 is taken as 1.

The 3 in 35 represents 3 tens. The position which 3 occupies is the 'tens place'. The place value of the position that the digit 3 occupies is 10.

In the following figure, each position has been marked using a square, and the position of each digit of 35 has been indicated.

35

Tens pl ace Ones place

Digit in the tens placeDigit in the ones place

Let us represent 35 on an abacus.

Tens Ones

For free distribution10

We learnt that 35 = 3 tens + 5 ones. In the same manner,

53 = 5 tens + 3 ones = 50 + 3,65 = 6 tens + 5 ones = 60 + 5 and 99 = 9 tens + 9 ones = 90 + 9

That is, there is a value represented by a digit in a number, according to the position of the digit.

Now, let us find the value represented by each digit of 35.

The value represented by 3 in the number 35 = 3 tens = 30

The value represented by 5 in the number 35 = 5 ones = 5

The maximum value that can be represented by a digit in the ones place is 9. The maximum value that can be represented by a digit in the tens place is 90.

The maximum number of counters that can be placed on a single rod of an abacus is 9.

2.2 Place value described further

Tens placeOnes place

The greatest number that can be written using two positions is 99. It has 9 tens and 9 ones. The number which is one greater than 99 is hundred.

The tens place and ones place are not sufficient to write the number hundred in digits. Hence the place value corresponding to the position to the left of the tens place is taken as 100 and that position is named as the hundreds place.

Tens placeHundreds placeOnes place

Therefore hundred is written using three positions as 100.

Now let us look at numbers which are written by using digits in three positions.

Several numbers which can be formed using the digits 2, 4 and 5 are given below. Consider the ways of using 5 in these numbers.

245 Two hundred forty five254Two hundred fifty four524Five hundred twenty four

In 245, the digit 5 is in the ones place.The value represented by 5 in 245 = 5 ones = 5

In 254, the digit 5 is in the tens place.The value represented by 5 in 254 = 5 tens = 50

In 524, the digit 5 is in the hundreds place.The value represented by 5 in 524 = 5 hundreds = 500

It is clear that the value represented by 5 in the above numbers varies according to the position of 5.

The place value corresponding to the position of each digit in a number from right to left is respectively 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 etc.

Accordingly, when two successive digits of a number are considered, the place value corresponding to the position of the digit on the left is ten times the place value corresponding to the position of the digit on the right.

Now, let us name the positions that each of the digits 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 occupies in the number 67524 by writing these digits in five positions.

4 is in the ones place of 67524.The value represented by 4 is 4.

2 is in the tens place of 67524. The value represented by 2 is 20.

5 is in the hundreds place of 67524. The value represented by 5 is 500.

2.3 Periods of numbers

The total number of students studying in several schools from grade 6 to 11 is 2836696.

See whether you can read the number of students given in the above statement. How numbers such as the above are read and written in words is described below.

Let us consider the number 2836696.Let us write this number by separating it into groups of three, starting from the ones place, as given below. 2 836 696A group separated in the above manner is known as a period of numbers or number zone.

In this separation, the number of positions with digits in the last period, that is, the leftmost period, may be less than three. Only the digit 2 is in the last period of the above number.

Let us name the periods of this number as follows.

For free distribution17

When writing a number in standard form, a small space is left between two periods to separate and identify the periods.

By writing a number in standard form, it can easily be read, and an idea can be obtained about its magnitude.

In some instances, to separate the periods, a comma is written between the periods instead of the small space.

3 Mathematical Operations on Whole Numbers

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,

z add whole numbers,

z subtract a whole number from a larger whole number,

z multiply whole numbers and

z divide a whole number by a whole number.

In this lesson, the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, which you have learnt earlier will be studied more methodically.

3.1 Adding whole numbers

Numbers such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, … are known as whole numbers.

First vendor Second Vendor

The first vendor has 12 balloons and the second vendor has 13 balloons. By counting the balloons, we can find out that the total number of balloons that the two vendors have is 25. This answer can also be obtained by separately adding the two digits in the ones (units) place together, and the two digits in the tens place together.

For free distribution23

Let us explain this addition using two methods.

(1) Let us add numbers together using counting frames.

Let us represent the numbers 12 and 13 on two counting frames.

12

HundredsTensOnesHundredsTensOnes

13

Let us place all the counters in the ones place of these two counting frames in the ones place of another counting frame. Let us also place all the counters in the tens place of both counting frames in the tens place of the new counting frame. This is illustrated below.

HundredsTensOnes

The number that is represented on this counting frame is 25.That is, 12 + 13 = 25

(2) Let us add the two numbers 12 and 13 by considering the value represented by the digit in each place of the numbers.

Number Value represented by the digit in the tens placeValue represented by the digit in the ones place

1210213103Sum205

The value represented by the digit in the tens place of the answer is 20. 20 is 2 tens. That is, the digit in the tens place of the answer is 2.

Similarly, the value represented by the digit in the ones place of the answer is 5. 5 is 5 ones. That is, the digit in the ones place of the answer is 5.

Since the digit in the tens place is 2 and the digit in the ones place is 5, the answer is 25. That is, 12 + 13 = 25

3.5 Multiplication of whole numbers described further

Let us consider 25 × 14.

25 × 14 is 14 twenty fives. This 14 twenty fives can be considered as 10 twenty fives and 4 twenty fives.

10 twenty fives is 250. 4 twenty fives is 100. Therefore, 14 twenty fives is 250 + 100, which is equal to 350.

That is, 25 × 14 = 10 twenty fives + 4 twenty fives = 250 + 100 = 350

What has occurred here is, that 25 has been multiplied by the value represented by each digit in 14 and the resulting values have been added together to obtain the answer.

Total number of olives is 10.

The number of olives that Rasika received is five.The number of olives that Sameera received is five.

Rasika and Sameera each received 5 olives.

We describe how the olives were divided between the two of them as “10 divided by 2”.

This is written as 10 ÷ 2.

Accordingly, 10 ÷ 2 = 5.This can be clarified in the following manner too.

There are 2 groups of five in 10. That is, 10 = 5 × 2. Therefore, a group has 5, when 10 is divided into two equal groups.

● identify the units of measuring time,● identify the relationships between different units of measuring time,● find the time taken for an activity,● express the time in terms of the 24 hour clock and ● write the date in standard form.

4.1 Reading the time on a 12 hour clock accurately

Find a clock similar to the one shown in the figure, which shows the correct time and observe it carefully.

² In this clock, the circular edge has been divided into 60 equal parts by short line segments.² The numbers from 1 up to 12 have been marked on the face of the clock, such that there are five equal parts between any two adjacent numbers.● From the three hands which are fixed at the centre, the shortest hand is the hour hand. The narrow hand in red is the seconds hand, and the remaining hand is the minute hand.● The three hands rotate in the direction in which the numbers on the face are increasing.● The time it takes for the pointed end of the hour hand to move from one number to the next is one hour.● The time it takes for the pointed end of the minute hand to move from one short line segment to the next is one minute.● The time it takes for the pointed end of the seconds hand to move from one short line segment to the next is one second.● During an hour, the minute hand rotates one round.

1 hour = 60 minutes

For free distribution40

● During one minute the seconds hand rotates one round.

1 minute = 60 seconds

● When the time is being read, the hour is taken to be the number which the hour hand is pointing towards or has last passed.

● The number of minutes and the number of seconds is taken to be the number of line segments each hand has last passed or is pointingtowards.

Let us read the time denoted by the clock in the figure.

Since the hour hand lies between the numbers 10 and 11, the number that the hour hand has last passed is 10.

The minute hand lies between the 25th and 26th line segments. Hence, the line segment that the minute hand has last passed is 25. The seconds hand is pointing towards the 13th line segment.

Therefore, the time is read as 25 minutes and 13 seconds past 10. This is written as 10.25.13. Sometimes, the number of seconds is not indicated. In such a case, the time is expressed as 10.25.

●Identifying the periods a.m. (ante meridiem) and p.m. (post meridiem)

The time according to both the above clocks is 7.00.● One clock shows the time a child goes to school as 7.00 in the morning.● The other clock shows the time a child is studying as 7.00 in the evening.Accordingly, since the clock shows the same time at two different instances of the day, how the time is indicated precisely is described below.* When all three hands of a clock point at 12 during the day time, the time is 12 noon.* When all three hands of a clock point at 12 during the night time, the time is 12 midnight.* The 12 hour time period between 12 midnight and 12 noon is known as “ante meridiem” (before midday).* The 12 hour time period between 12 noon and 12 midnight is known as “post meridiem” (after midday).* The period of time from 12 midnight of one day to 12 midnight of the next is called a day. The hour hand completes two rounds of the clock during a day.

That is, one day = 2 periods = 24 hours

Accordingly, in the above example,

7.00 in the morning is denoted by 7.00 a.m.(ante meridiem is written in short as a.m.)7.00 in the evening is denoted by 7.00 p.m. (post meridiem is written in short as p.m.)

4.2 Reading the time on a 24 hour clock

The figure depicts a 24 hour clock. The numbers from 1 up to 12 have been marked around the outer edge, and the numbers 13 up to 24 have been marked on an inner circle.

The ante meridiem time is read by considering the numbers from 1 to 12 and the post meridiem time is read by considering the number from 13 upto 24. The day starts at midnight. This time is denoted by 00:00.

Also, the day ends at midnight.This time is denoted by 24 :00.

The time, 30 minutes past the starting time of the day is denoted as 00:30.

10.30 a.m. is expressed as 10:30.12 noon is expressed as 12:00.1.00 p.m. is expressed as 13:00.6.00 p.m. is expressed as 18:00.

The time is written in international standard form as follows.

Hours : Minutes : Seconds hh : mm : ss

In this form, the hours, minutes and seconds have all to be expressed using two digits. When the number of seconds is not required, the time is expressed in hours and minutes.For example, 3 minutes and 48 seconds past 1 in the afternoon written in international standard form is 13:03:48.

When writing the date in standard form,● first the year, then the month and finally the day should be written.● four digits should be used to represent the year, two digits to represent the month and two digits to represent the day. The 8th of April, 2015 is represented in international standard form as 2015 - 04 - 08.

The time the day 2015 - 05 - 08 ends at 12 midnight is represented by 2015 - 05 - 08 24:00. This time can also be written as 2015 - 05 - 09 00:00.

4.4 Relationships between units of measuring time

Seconds, minutes, hours and days are several units that are used to measure time. Now, let us consider the relationships between these units.

●Representing time given in minutes, in terms of seconds Since 1 minute = 60 seconds, 2 minutes = 120 seconds and 3 minutes = 180 seconds.That is, to represent the time given in minutes, in terms of seconds, the given number of minutes needs to be multiplied by 60.

For free distribution46

Example 1Express 8 minutes in seconds.

Exercise 4.3

(1) Express each of the following times given in minutes, in terms of seconds.

(i) 1 minute (ii) 6 minutes (iii) 30 minutes(iv) 20 minutes (v) 38 minutes (vi) 48 minutes

² Representing time given in seconds, in terms of minutes

Since 60 seconds = 1 minute,120 seconds = 2 minutes and180 seconds = 3 minutes.

That is, to represent time given in seconds, in terms of minutes, the given number of seconds needs to be divided by 60.

Example 1

Express 360 seconds in minutes.

60 seconds = 1 minute360 seconds = 360 ÷ 60 minutes = 6 minutes

Example 2

² Relationship between days and hours

Since 1 day = 24 hours, 2 days = 48 hours and 3 days = 72 hours.

That is, to represent a certain number of days in hours, the given number of days needs to be multiplied by 24.

Similarly, 24 hours = 1 day 48 hours = 2 days 72 hours = 3 days

That is, to represent a time given in hours, in terms of days, the given number of hours needs to be divided by 24.

Example 1

Express 4 days in terms of hours.1 day = 24 hours4 days = 24 « 4 hours = 96 hours

Example 2 Example 3 Express 37 hours in days and hours.

24 hours = 1 day37 hours = 24 hours + 13 hours = 1 day and 13 hours

4.5 Elapsed time

Now, let us find the elapsed time by considering two times.

For free distribution51

Sumith’s mother left home at 2.00 p.m. to visit the market. She returned home at 3.30 p.m. Let us find the time that has elapsed from the moment she left her home until she returned from the market.

Method 1

The time period between 2.00 p.m. and 3.00 p.m. is 1 hour.The time period between 3.00 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. is 30 minutes.Therefore, the time that has elapsed is 1 hour and 30 minutes. ●Elapsed time corresponding to an incident which has occured during a period (a.m. or p.m.) can be found easily as follows.

Method 2

Time his mother returned home = 3.30 p.m.Time his mother left home = 2.00 p.m.

To find the time that has elapsed, the difference between the time she returned and the time she left has to be found.

Hours Minutes 3 30 - 2 00 1 30

Accordingly, the time that elapsed between the time Sumith’s mother left home and the time she returned is 1 hour and 30 minutes.

To find the elapsed time of a task or an event, the difference between the time it started and the time it ended needs to be found.

Example 1

To prepare for the term test, Samith’s sister studied from 7.30 p.m. to 10.15 p.m. yesterday. Find the time his sister spent studying.

Time she finished studying = 10.15 p.m.Time she started studying = 7.30 p.m.Here both the times are in p.m.To find the time she spent studying, let us find the difference between the time she started studying and the time she finished studying.

Hours Minutes 10 15- 7 30 2 45

●Since 30 minutes cannot be subtracted from 15 minutes, let us carry 1 hour, that is 60 minutes, from the 10 hours in the hours column to the minutes column.

●Then, number of minutes = 15 + 60 minutes = 75 minutes. ●Now, let us subtract 30 minutes from 75 minutes. Then we obtain 45 minutes. ●Now, let us subtract 7 hours from the remaining 9 hours in the hours column. Then we obtain 2 hours. ●Therefore, the answer is 2 hours and 45 minutes.

Example 2

A school prize giving started at 9.30 a.m. and ended at 1.45 p.m. Find the duration of the event.Since the starting time is ante meridiem and the ending time is post meridiem, to find the duration, let us write the time according to the 24 - hour clock.

Starting time = 09:30 Ending time = 13:45 Duration = 13:45 – 09:30 = 4 hours and 15 minutes

In problems related to elapsed time (or duration), corresponding to incidents which have occured during the same day, it is convenient to solve the problem by writing the time, according to the 24 - hour clock.

5.3 Comparison of integers

Let us consider the numbers five and two. We know that five is greater than two. We can write this as “five is greater than two”. The way this can be expressed concisely using symbols is given below.

5 > 2Here the symbol “ > ” which expresses the meaning “greater than” has been placed between the numbers five and two.

Similarly, the fact that 9 is greater than 4 can be expressed as 9 > 4.The fact that two is less than five can be expressed as follows. 2 < 5

The symbol “< ” expresses the meaning “less than”.Accordingly, 4 is less than 9 is symbolized as 4 < 9.

When two integers are being compared, these symbols need to be used in the following manner.

Larger integer > Smaller integerSmaller integer < Larger integer

The symbols “>” and “<” are called inequality signs.

The pointed side of these symbols is in the direction of the smaller number.

The above mentioned numbers have been marked on the number line given below.

-4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Any number to the right of a particular number on the number line is greater (larger) than the said number. This property is applicable to the whole number line. Therefore, this rule can be applied to compare integers using the number line.

For free distribution70

Let us consider which number from 0 and -2 is greater. Let us draw a number line and mark 0 and -2 on it.

0 1 2 3 4 5 -3 -2 -1

On the number line, 0 is to the right of - 2. Therefore, 0 is greater than -2.This can be written as 0 > -2.In the same manner, let us consider which number from -5 and -1 is greater.Let us draw a number line and mark -5 and -1 on it.

0 1 2 3 4 5 -6-3-1-2-4-5

On the number line, -1 is to the right of -5.

Therefore, -1 is greater than -5. This can be written as -1 > -5

Example 1

Compare the numbers - 4 and 1. Let us draw a number line and mark - 4 and 1 on it.

3201-1-2-3- 4-5

On the number line, 1 is to the right of - 4. The comparison of these two numbers can therefore be expressed in either one of the following two ways.1 is greater than - 4 can be expressed as 1 > - 4.- 4 is less than 1can be expressed as - 4 < 1.

Example 2

Fill in the following blanks using a suitable number from 6, 11 and 13.

(i) 11 < ...... (ii) 11 > ...... (iii) 11 = ......

then we have,

(i) 11 < ......13 (ii) 11 > ......6 (iii) 11 =......11

5.4 Comparison of integers described further

The number line can easily be used to compare more than two numbers together.

For example, let us take the integers 3, 0, -1 and -3 and compare them by using a number line.

0 1 2 3 4 - 4 -3 -2 -1On a number line, “the values of numbers increase gradually from left to right”. Therefore, if the above numbers are written in increasing order of their values, we get -3, -1, 0, 3. If we write numbers in increasing order of their values as above, we say that the numbers are written in ascending order.

For free distribution72

The above numbers can also be written as 3, 0, -1, -3 with the values gradually decreasing. If we write several numbers in this manner in decreasing order of their values, we say that the numbers are written in descending order.

5.5 Finding integers between two non-consecutive integers

Sitha is 10 years old. Her brother, Madhava is 6 years old. Sriya who lives in a nearby house comes often to play with the two of them. Her age in years is between 6 and 10.

The integers between 6 and 10 are only 7, 8, and 9.Therefore, Sriya's age in years can be considered to be either 7, 8 or 9.This can easily be found using a number line too.

6 Estimation and Rounding Off

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,

z understand what estimation means,

z give a good estimate when required,

z understand what rounding off means and

z round off a whole number to the nearest multiple of ten.

6.1 Estimation

How many pieces of milk rice are there on the plate in this figure? 12

How many olives are there in the palm of this hand? 7

In the above two situations the correct amounts could easily be told by counting the number of items there are.

Can the correct number of newspapers, the correct number of bananas and the correct number of marbles in the following figures be stated as easily by counting the items?

For free distribution77

To know the exact number of items in each figure, it is necessary to count the items. This is not always possible. However, a person with experience can make a good guess and come up with a close value.

Finding a close value for the number of items there are in a certain collection of items, without counting the items, but using a suitable method instead, is defined as estimation.

In estimation, the method that is most often used to guess the number of items there are in a collection, is to find a value close to the total number of items, by considering the number of items there are in a portion of the collection. In this method, the portion that is considered is taken as a unit, and the total number of items is estimated by considering the number of items there are in the unit.

Example 1

The figure shows two stacks of copies of a certain newspaper. There are 10 newspapers in stack B. Estimate the number of newspapers there are in stack A.It is clear by making a comparison of the heights of the two stacks using the divided line in the figure, that the height of stack A is roughly four times the height of stack B.

Stack A Stack B

The number of newspapers in stack B = 10The number of newspapers in stack A is approximately = 10 × 4 = 40

Therefore, the number of marbles there were initially in the container P is approximately = 112

6.2 Rounding off

38 students are to participate in a field trip. However, the teacher in charge informs the Principal that the number of students who will be participating in the field trip is about 40. Here 40, which is the multiple of ten that is closest to 38 has been given as an approximate value of 38.

There are many instances in day to day activities when the multiple of ten which is closest to a given number is used as an approximate value of that number. We do this in order to get an idea about the number easily.

For example, the number of students in six classes in grade 6 of a particular school are 28, 31, 29, 30, 31 and 32. In such an instance we may say that the number of students in a class is approximately 30.

In the above instance, a number which is greater than 10 has been expressed as the multiple of ten which is closest to it. That is, the number has been rounded off to the nearest multiple of ten.

z Write down each of these numbers in the box which is under the multiple of ten that is closest to it. If a number is right in the middle of two multiples of ten, write the number in the box which is under the nearest multiple of ten which is larger than it.

z Identify how a number can be rounded off to the nearest multiple of ten by examining the digit in the ones place of the number.

z Were you able to grasp the following rules of rounding off through the above activity?

When rounding off a number to the nearest multiple of ten, if the digit in the ones place of the number

z is less than 5, then the closest multiple of ten which is less than that number is selected.

z is 5 or greater than 5, then the closest multiple of ten which is greater than that number is selected.

Example 1 Round off the following numbers to the nearest multiple of ten and write them down.

Niromi received 67 marks. Since she received more marks than Iresha did, Iresha’s marks should be less than 67.

The values that are less than 67, which when rounded off to the nearest multiple of ten gives 70 are 65 and 66 only. Therefore, the values that the marks Iresha received can take are 65 and 66.

An angle is formed by two straight line segments meeting as shown in the figure. The point at which the two straight line segments meet is known as the vertex of the angle.

The two straight line segments are known as the arms of the angle. The angle is marked with a curved line segment as indicated in red.

Several angles are shown in the following figure.

8 Directions

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,

●express the location of a place from a given location in terms of the eight directions and ●identify the horizontal and the vertical.

8.1 The main directions

• Strong winds in the North-eastern shores of the island – A weathernotification• It is auspicious to light the hearth at 8.05 a.m. while facing the East – a New Year Custom• A meteor shower can be observed in the south-western sky between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. – A news item.

The above are several instances in day to day life, where directions are mentioned. Thus, knowledge of directions is required when conducting daily activities.

Now, let us recall what was learnt earlier regarding the four main directions.

The East is the direction in which the sun rises. If you stand as shown in the figure with your arms stretched out, facing the East, then the direction indicated by your right hand is the South and the direction indicated by your left hand is the North. Then the direction behind you is the West.

For free distribution97

When directions are drawn in a book, the following convention is used.

North (N)

West (W)East (E)

South (S)

The North is indicated in maps and in house plans by the notation '' '' N .

A compass can be used to accurately find the directions from a given position. Let us now consider how it works.

When a compass is placed on a flat surface, the red needle points in the direction of the North. When the compass is rotated such that the letter N is aligned with the point of the red needle, the remaining directions too are indicated by the compass.

The following figure shows an instance where the needle is pointed in the direction of the North.

The following figure shows the instance of aligning the point of the needle with the letter N of the compass.

8.2 Sub directions

Apart from these four main directions, let us now learn about four other sub directions.

* The direction which divides the right angle between the North and the East exactly into two as shown in the figure is the North-east.* The direction which divides the right angle between the East and the South exactly into two as shown in the figure is the South-east.

* The direction which divides the right angle between the South and the West exactly into two as shown in the figure is the South-west.* The direction which divides the right angle between the West and the North exactly into two as shown in the figure is the North-west.

Eight directions - North, East, South, West, North-east, South-east, South-west and North-west.

8.3 The horizontal and the vertical

Apart from the directions we have talked about so far, there are two other concepts which are necessary to describe the location of an object. These are the horizontal and the vertical.

The surface of the water in a large basin is considered to be horizontal when the water is still.A flat surface which is not inclined, is said to be in a horizontal plane.

Any straight line which lies on a horizontal plane is called a horizontal line.Any two points which lie on a horizontal plane, are said to be at the same level.

Consider several small balls on a horizontal plane. We say that these balls are in the same horizontal level.

For free distribution104

Take a string which has a small weight tied to it at one end, and hold it by the other end. Wait until the string stops moving. Then the line along which the string lies is a vertical line.

If a plane contains a vertical line, then it is a vertical plane.

Any straight line which lies on a horizontal plane is a horizontal line. But any straight line which lies on a vertical plane is not necessarily a vertical line.

A

When two points lie on the same vertical line, we say that one point lies vertically above the other. For example, the given line is vertical and point B lies vertically above the point A.

Let us identify several other vertical and horizontal positions.

The top surface lies in a horizontal plane. The top surface is said to be horizontal.

The edge lies along a horizontal line. The edge is said to be horizontal.

9 Fractions

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,

●identify proper fractions, unit fractions and equivalent fractions,

●compare proper fractions and

●add and subtract proper fractions.

9.1 Introduction

The picture below shows how a sister and a brother divided a Guava into two equal parts.

The picture below shows how three people divided a cake into three equal parts.

For free distribution113

There are many such situations where a whole unit is divided into equal parts.

In the first situation, a person received one part out of the two equal parts of the Guava. If we numerically represent the Guava as 1 , then the numerical representation of the part a person receives is 12 . This is read as “one half ”.

In the above second situation, a person received one part of the three equal parts the cake was divided. If we numerically represent the cake

as 1, then the quantity one person receives is

13 . This is read as “one third”.

Let us consider further, the parts obtained by dividing a whole unit into equal parts as shown in the pictures below.

1

Let us take the coloured quantity as one unit , and represent it numerically as one.

12

The same unit is now divided into two equal parts , and one part is coloured. The coloured quantity is 12. This is read as “one half ”. There are two 12

quantities in a unit.

13

The same unit is now divided into three equal parts , and one part is coloured. The coloured quantity is 13. This is read as “one third ”. There are three 13 quantities in a unit.

14

The same unit is now divided into four equal parts , and one part is coloured. The coloured quantity is 14. This is read as “one fourth ”. There are four 14

quantities in a unit.

For free distribution114

23

The same unit is now divided into three equal parts, and two parts are coloured. The coloured quantity is 23. This is read as “two thirds ”.

Note

In general use, we read

12 as half, 14 as quarter and as three quarters.

If we consider each of the figures below as a whole unit, and numerically represent each figure as 1, then the coloured quantities are

and respectively.

What we have done so far is to,● numerically represent the quantity shown by a unit as 1.● divide that unit into equal parts.● numerically represent the quantity shown by one or several of those parts.The numbers, which are less than one and greater than zero represented in this manner are known as proper fractions. Some examples of proper fractions are and 38.

9.2 The denominator and the numerator of a fraction

Consider the fraction 47 .

Here, 7 is the number of parts a whole unit is divided equally into. We call it the denominator of the fraction. It is written below the line of the fraction.

4 is the number of parts considered. We call it the numerator of the fraction. It is written above the line of the fraction.

47

numeratordenominator

When we write a fraction numerically in this manner,

● the number written below the line is defined as the denominator of the fraction. ● the number written above the line is defined as the numerator of the fraction.

In a proper fraction, the numerator is always less than its denominator.

Consider the fractions such as 12 " 13" 1

4 and 15, where the numerator is one. Such fractions are called unit fractions.

Such a fraction indicates the quantity of one part by dividing a whole unit into equal parts. These fraction are important because they can be used to explain other fractions.

Let us now explain 23 in terms of 13

.

Let us represent this by a figure.

This picture is divided into three equal parts. One part is

13 of the whole unit. The coloured quantity, that is, 23 is two such parts. That is 23 is two 13s.

Similarly,

34 is, three 14 s, 57 is five 17 s and three 15 s is 35.

9.3 Equivalent fractions

Take two white circular shaped cards of the same size.

Step 1 - Fold the first circular card once, so that it is divided into two equal parts.

Step 2 - Fold the second circular card twice, so that it is divided into four equal parts.

Step 3 - Unfold both cards and colour half of each of them. Then we obtain the following figure.

The coloured portion of this card is

24 of the entire card.The coloured portion of this card

is

12 of the entire card.

The coloured quantity of the entire card is the same in both cards.Therefore, the numbers represented by 12 and 24 are the same.

Accordingly, 12 = 24

Such fractions which represent the same value although they have different denominators and different numerators, are known as equivalent fractions.

Accordingly, 12 and 24 are equivalent fractions.

Activity 1

11 332236×==×, Here, the denominator and the numerator are multiplied by 3'

, Here, the denominator and the numerator are multiplied by 4'

9.5 Addition and subtraction of fractions

● Addition and subtraction of fractions having the same denominator. A cake was brought home. Mother divided it into 8 equal parts. Then one part is 18

of the whole cake.

Damith ate 2 parts, that is 28 of the cake at tea time. His sister ate another

part, that is 18 of the cake at tea time. The total amount Damith and his sister ate is three 18s. That is, 38.

Therefore, when a quantity of

28 is added to a quantity of 18

, the total quantity is 38.

For free distribution126

Let us show this symbolically.

888= 3

In this manner, when adding two fractions having the same denominator, the denominator of the answer is the same as the denominators of the added fractions. The numerator of the answer is the addition of the numerators of the added fractions.

11 Factors and Multiples

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,

●find the factors and multiples of a whole number,●solve problems related to factors and multiples and●examine whether a whole number is divisible by 2, 5 and 10.

11.1 Identifying factors

Consider a class consisting of six children. Suppose an equal number of children should sit in each row. The ways in which the 6 chairs can be arranged is shown below.

1 row with 6 chairs in the row

(i)

2 rows with 3 chairs in each row

(ii)

3 rows with 2 chairs in each row

(iii)

6 rows with 1 chair in each row

(iv)

In such arrangements, the total number of 6 chairs is obtained by the product of the number of chairs in a row and the number of rows. By that it is clear that, there are many ways of writing 6, as a product of two whole numbers.

6 = 1 × 6 6 = 2 × 3 6 = 3 × 2 6 = 6 × 1

For free distribution141

Now, let us consider how the chairs in a classroom can be arranged as above if there are twelve chairs. In this arrangement also, the total number of chairs is obtained by the product of the number of chairs in a row and the number of rows.12 = 1 × 1212 = 2 × 612 = 3 × 412 = 4 × 312 = 6 × 212 = 12 × 1In this manner, any whole number can be written as a product of two whole numbers in various ways.

When a whole number is written as a product of two whole numbers, those two numbers are known as factors of the original number.

Since 6 = 1 × 6, the numbers 1 and 6 are factors of 6.Since 6 = 2 × 3, the numbers 2 and 3 are also factors of 6.When the products relevant to 6 are considered, we obtain that the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6.Similarly, the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.

Now, let us find the factors of 16.We can write 16 in the following ways as a product of two whole numbers.16 = 1 × 1616 = 2 × 816 = 4 × 416 = 8 × 216 = 16 × 1Accordingly, the factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16.When we consider the above products relevant to 16, we see that it is sufficient to write only the following products to obtain the factors of 16. 16 = 1 × 16 16 = 2 × 8 16 = 4 × 4

(5) Is 4 a factor of 9? Explain the reason for your answer.

11.3 Finding the factors using the method of division

When a number is divided by a factor, there is no remainder. Let us establish this fact through the following examples. The factors of 6 have been obtained before as 1, 2, 3 and 6. When 6 is divided by each of the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 6, there is no remainder.

6 ÷ 1 = 6 with remainder 0. 6 ÷ 2 = 3 with remainder 0.

6 ÷ 3 = 2 with remainder 0. 6 ÷ 6 = 1 with remainder 0.

For free distribution145

Let us divide 6 by 4 and 5 which are not factors of 6.

614426 ÷ 4 = 1 with a remainder of 2.

6

155

6 ÷ 5 = 1 with a remainder of 1.

Accordingly, when 6 is divided by any of its factors 1, 2, 3 or 6, there is no remainder. However, when 6 is divided by 4 or 5 which are not factors of 6, there is a remainder of 2 and 1 respectively.

If a certain whole number can be divided by another whole number such that there is no remainder, then we identify the second number as a factor of the first number.

Since any whole number can be divided by 1 and the number itself with no remainder, 1 and the number itself are factors of the given number.

9 is not a factor of 12. 112 93

11.4 Multiples

The answers that are obtained when 2 is multiplied by the whole numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are given below.

2 × 1 = 22 × 2 = 42 × 3 = 62 × 4 = 82 × 5 = 10A number which is obtained by multiplying 2 by a whole number in this manner is known as a multiple of 2.In the same manner, a number which is obtained by multiplying 3 by a whole number is known as a multiple of 3.

●3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 are several multiples of three.Similarly, ●5, 10, 15 and 20 are several multiples of five.Also, observe the following results. ●All the multiples of 2 can be divided by 2 with no remainder. ●All the multiples of 3 can be divided by 3 with no remainder.

It is clear that any multiple of a whole number can be divided by that number with no remainder.

For free distribution147

Let us discuss more about multiples.

Consider the numbers which can be written as a product of two whole numbers.

For example, 18 = 3 × 6.

Here 18 is obtained by multiplying 3 by 6. That is, 18 is a multiple of 3.We may write 18 = 6 × 3 as well.

Therefore 18 is obtained by multiplying 6 by 3 and hence 18 is a multipleof 6. That is, 18 is a multiple of both 3 and 6.

Example 1

Check whether 14 is a multiple of 2 by dividing 14 by 2.

11.5 Divisibility

Through divisibility we can learn about the ability of one whole number to divide another whole number, without a remainder.

Given two numbers, if there is no remainder when one number is divided by the other, then the first number is said to be divisible by the second number.

For example, when 27 is divided by 3, there is no remainder. Therefore, 27 is divisible by 3.

● Examining whether a number is divisible by 2

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 ●Draw a circle around each of the above numbers which is divisible by 2. ●Write down the digit in the ones place of each number that is divisible by 2. ●Then you will obtain the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 and 0. Observe that these too are divisible by 2. ●Examine the digits in the ones place of the numbers which are not divisible by 2 (not circled). They are 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. These are not divisible by 2.

Activity 2

Accordingly, if the value of the digit in the ones place of a number is divisible by 2, then the number is divisible by 2. Also, if the value of the digit in the ones place of a number is not divisible by 2, then the number is not divisible by 2.

The digit in the ones place of these numbers is always 0 or 5.

That is, if the digit in the ones place of a number is 0 or 5 then that number is divisible by 5.

● Examining whether a number is divisible by 10
