    "text": "Your face is the best mirror which reflects your thoughts, feelings and emotions. Observe your face with a mirror to see how your facial expressions change when feel happy, sad, fearful or angry. Your body expressions in such situations may be crying, laughing, frowning, being silent, being frightened, being disappointed and being lethargic. Good emotions are delightful for oneself as well as for the society. However, if unfavourable emotions are not properly manipulated, they will cause harm not only to you but to the society too. For example, a person raged with anger may tend to scold others, assault them, destroy property and even cause death. We can hear from everyday news various incidents resulted in failing to control emotions. Discuss with your teacher about this. He/She will explain you.",

    "text": "e.g. :- A Tsunami, A landslide, a fire in an armoury, a bomb blast, On such an occasion those who merely visit such places can face the same accident. Therefore, we must refrain from gathering in such places unnecessarily. It is also necessary to be aware of media reports to avoid chain accidents. Paying attention to weather reports, being aware of changes in natural surroundings and taking immediate action in the event of a landslide are all helpful to minimize damages. It is also important to pay attention to the behaviours of animals because they have a better instinct to identify the changes in the natural environment than humans. Our ancestors paid their serious attention to the sounds of frogs, emergence of grown and winged termites, the flying pattern of swallows etc. Accordingly, in the event of a natural disaster, they were able to help themselves immediately and others with minimum casualties. It is essential that we develop ourselves for instant action and make correct decisions to suit the occasion. Such timely and necessary action taken consciously and intelligently will not only help avoid accidents or damages but also help with quick management of a disastrous situation. This will also contribute towards safeguarding lives and property and helping sound lives towards a developed country with a sound and strong economy.Disasters due to human activities",
