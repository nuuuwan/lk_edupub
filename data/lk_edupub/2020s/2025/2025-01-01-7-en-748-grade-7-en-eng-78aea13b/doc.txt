Flying Kites

Flying kites is a popular pastime in our country. There are kites of different shapes, colours and sizes. Cobra and peacock-shaped kites are most popular among children. August is the best season for flying kites in Sri Lanka because it is dry and windy. Furthermore, most children have their school holidays in August. This gives them much time to fly kites and have fun. Making a kite is easy and inexpensive. Kites can be made using the midrib of coconut leaflets or bamboo sticks, tissue papers, cotton twine and glue. It is believed that the first kite was made in China. In the past, kites were used in war to send signals to their troops. Even today the Chinese consider the kite as a symbol of good fortune. Kites are flown in open areas like paddy fields, beaches and large fields.They are flown by young children and adults alike because it is an entertaining recreational activity. Flying kites is enjoyable not only to those who are flying them but also to the spectators. The International Kite Festival and other competitions are held in Sri Lanka annually. One such competition was held at the Duraiyappa Stadium in Jaffna in 2014. One of the highlights of this event was the awarding of a special prize to a ninety-four year old participant for taking part in this competition.
