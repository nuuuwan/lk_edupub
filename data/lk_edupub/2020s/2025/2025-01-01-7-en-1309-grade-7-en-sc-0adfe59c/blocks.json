    "text": "This textbook was compiled by the Educational Publications Department in accordance with the syllabus prepared by the National Institute of Education for the use of Grade seven students in the Sri Lankan school system with effect from 2016.An effort has made here to arrange the subject content to suit the national educational goals, common national competencies, the objectives of teaching science and the content of the syllabus.The subject of science directs the student towards a more active learning process in a manner as to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes needed for a developmental scientific thought.In the compilation of this textbook, subject content is largely arranged based on experiences of daily life. It has contributed to prove the fact that the subject of press; science is very much closer to the day-to-day life.The compilation of this textbook based on activities is a distinctive feature. The activities are prepared based on the scientific method in order to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes. Activities that can be performed individually at home as well as in school are incorporated here. We believe that learning through activities would contribute to create a liking and an interest in the child towards learning science. At the end of each chapter, a summary, a series of exercises and a glossary were included. It enables the student to identify the important details of the chapter as well as to self evaluate the achievement of learning outcomes.For the purpose of directing the student to study further about the subject matter, more information is included in the \"For extra knowledge\". It is given only to broaden the subject area of the child and certainly not to ask questions at term tests.Assignments and projects are given with the purpose of directing the student towards an explorative study. It enables the students to develop the higher order skills such as application, analysis and synthesis of the concepts achieved from the lesson.We strongly believe that the duty of the teachers who teach science is to direct the student for self learning instead of teaching the student using traditional teaching methods. This textbook can be utilized by the teachers as a learning tool to execute their teaching role properly. We would like to bestow our sincere thanks on the senior lecturer Asoka De Silva of the National Institute of Education and the professional writer Dr. K. Ariyasinghe.We kindly request you to forward your comments and suggestions on this textbook to the Educational Publications Department.",

    "text": "We hear the voice of the teacher in the classroom, because sound travels through air towards our ears. But two astronauts in the space cannot hear each other because there is no air in the space for sound to travel through. Thus, it is clear that sound does not travel in an empty space and sound needs a medium to travel. Sound which is produced from a sound source, travels from where it is originated know as propagation of sound. We hear different sounds when sound propagate through air to our ears.Does sound travel only through air? Let us do Activity 11.6 to find out whether sound propagates through liquid and solid medium.",

If it is the night time you will see stars, planets and sometimes the moon. You see all these objects through the atmosphere. But you cannot see the atmosphere.Atmosphere is a thin layer of gases that surrounds the earth. It spreads up nearly 700 km from the earth surface.In grade six you have learnt that gases have a mass. The weight of the gases above us make a pressure on us and all the things around us. This pressure is known as atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure is measured in milli bars (mb) to forecast the weather.",

It may be clear to you that the path of the escalator is linear and is shorter than the path of the staircase.You may travel from one place to another when you go on a trip. A person may go from one floor to another in a multi-storeyed building. An escalator goes up and down in a straight path. The change of position, with time, of living or non living objects is known as motion.Distance is the total length of the path of a motion. Here, the direction of motion may or may not change from time to time. Therefore, distance has not a definite direction.Displacement is the linear length between the starting and ending positions of a motion. When mentioning displacement, the direction of motion should always be indicated.Recall Activity 16.1 you did above. You may have understood that the length of the road between two cities is known as the distance and the straight distance is known as the displacement. Geographical directions or the direction from one city towards the other can be used to mention the direction between the two cities. The same way, motion along a staircase is the distance and motion of an escalator is the displacement. The direction of the displacement is the direction of the motion of the lift.To find out more about distance and displacement, let us consider the following facts. Recall the 100 metre and 400 metre running events of a sportsmeet.",
