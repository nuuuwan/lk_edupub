The early Olympic Games were held with a view of developing a healthy body and mind, upgrading social ethics and creating a law abiding society. The political and socio-economic changes that took place in various countries in the world influenced the field of sports as well. Along with the socio-economic developments that took place, the needs of the participants in sports changed. Consequently most sports developed into a highly organized state to cater to the needs and demands of the society. In order to address issues related to each sport, governing bodies at national and international levels were established and rules and regulations were formulated.",

The West Indian bowler was running to deliver the last ball, the Pakistani batsman at the bowlers end had walked forward past the crease. At this point, the bowler could have easily run out the Pakistani player and won the match instead he stopped there, held the ball close to the wicket and warned him not to move forward. In the last delivery Pakistan scored the required four runs and won the match.
