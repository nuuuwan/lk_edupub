    "text": "My favourite animal is the zebra. I like zebras the most, because they are very innocent animals. They belong to the horse family and live in groups. They are mammals and are herbivorous. Every zebra has a special pattern of black and white stripes. A baby zebra is brown and white at birth and is called a foal. Zebras walk and gallop like horses. They hear and see very well. Their eyes are on the sides of the head. It helps them to see what is happening all around them. They have large pointed ears and can turn their ears to any direction. Zebras are fast runners. They can run about 35 miles per hour. They run from side to side to protect from animals who hunt them. They sleep while standing and bray when they are in danger to warn the other zebras. The leader of the herd of zebras stays at the back of the group. Today, the zebras have lost many of their land and are in danger because of humans. Humans have destroyed many of the land to build houses and to cultivate. The zebras are also killed for their skin. Their skin is used to make carpets, coats and hand bags. Many governments have built national parks to protect the zebras but we all have to stop doing things that harm animals like my favourite animal, the zebra.",
