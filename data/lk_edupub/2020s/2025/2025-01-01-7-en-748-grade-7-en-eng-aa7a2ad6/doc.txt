Reading

Have you heard of “The Seven Voyages of Sinbad?” Here is a part of his first voyage. Read and answer the questions. “When I was a young man, my father died leaving me a very large fortune. I spent most of it enjoying myself. At last, I began to think, unless I wish to become poor, I had better try to make some more money. So, having bought some goods, I set sail for the Persian Gulf, hoping to sell or exchange them at a profit. The ship stopped at several ports, where we did some good trading.

One day, when the ship could not move, we saw what seemed to be a little green field peeping above the water. Thinking it very strange, a group of us rowed out to it, taking some fire and food.We had all landed and were in the middle of our meal when we found to our horror that we were on the back of some huge sea-monster. The creature shook its great body, and lashed its tail so angrily that many jumped into the boat, others into the sea, and soon I was the only one on the sea monster.
