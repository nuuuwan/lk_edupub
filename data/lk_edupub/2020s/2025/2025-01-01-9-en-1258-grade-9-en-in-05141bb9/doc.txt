Computer specifications1.4

What are computer specifications?

Before purchasing an item, it is important to be aware of the value and the quality of the item. Specifications are generally about the common features of an item.

For example, length, width and paper thickness, etc. determine quality of an exercise book. Basic specifications for an exercise book are as shown.

Basic specifications for an exercise book

Length : 210 mmWidth : 148 mmNumber of pages : 40Thickness of paper : 60 GSMType : Single ruled

Similar to the specification of a book, a computer also has its specification.

For free distribution

Specifications to suit different user requirements

Consider a situation where two students use two types of books for different purposes. For example, a square ruled exercise book for mathematics and a large size drawing book for art. Specifications for the two types mentioned above are as follows:

Specifications for an exercise book

Length : 210 mmWidth : 148 mmNumber of pages : 200Thickness of paper : 60 GSMType : Square ruled

Specifications for a drawing book

Length : 300 mmWidth : 210 mmNumber of pages : 20Thickness of paper : 70 GSMType : Blank

Different specifications for different purposes may result in price differences as well.

The specifications change according to user requirements in the above example. Similarly depending on the use of a computer its specifications also differs.

Specifications of computers and peripheral devices 1.5

The following shows some important factors of computer specifications;

Important - One can generally assure the quality of an item through its specifications.

1.5.1 The processor

Figure 1.4 : the human brain

Humans are considered the most intelligent among all living beings. The brain (Figure 1.4) helps man to make decisions for actions taken. The brain also has the ability to swiftly respond to all sensations.

8For free distribution

Much as the brain is most important for humans, the processor (Central Processing Unit) (Figure 1.5) is the most important part of a computer. The processor processes data swiftly. As such, the processor is considered the "Brain" of the computer.

The side that connects to the mother board

Figure. 1.5 : Central Processing Unit

View from above

Speed of the processor

A machine functions at a slower speed takes a longer time to complete a task while a machine functions at a higher speed takes a shorter or a lesser time to complete a task. Therefore, the amounts of work that could be carried out using these machines during a unit time differs.

Blender working at slower speed

Blender working at higher speed

Figure 1.6 : Preparation of fruit juice using blenders with different speeds

For free distribution

Figure 1.6 shows two blenders working simultaneously. The blender working at higher speed processes a larger quantity of fruit juice per unit time. A machine working at a higher speed provides better results.

The performance of a computer depends on the speed of the processor. A processor running at high speed is able to process more data during a unit time. That is, the performance of the computer is increases. Then the software can be run faster. Therefore, when selecting a processor, it is advisable to select one with a greater speed.

The speed of the processor is measured by the number of instructions executed per second.

Important - The speed of a computer is determined by the number of instructions execute per second.

The speed is measured in Hertz (units such as MHz or GHz).

1000 MHz = 1 GHz

Processor manufacturers

Figure 1.7 : Different processors

Several processor manufacturing companies, Apple, Intel and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) exists.

Types of processors Generally, the number of processors in a central processing unit is used to classify the Central Processing Unit. The following table shows examples of some Intel Central Processing Units with multiple processor units.

Dual CoreDual Core/Core 2 Duo

Quad CoreCore i3, i5, i7, i9

Refer to workbook for Activity 1.3.

1.5.2Hard disk

The hard disk provides permanent storage space for storing data and to installing all software. The hard disk is the main secondary storage device in a computer.

For example, an exercise book with 160 pages provide more writing space than a book with 40 pages. Similarly, more data can be stored in a hard disk with a greater storage capacity. (see figure 1.8).

1.5.3The monitor display

The main output device of a computer is its monitor display. Most often, a user interacts with a computer via its monitor/ display.

Monitor size

For examples, a wall clock is larger than a wrist watch. Time is easily seen on a wall clock because of its size. Similarly, larger monitors have better visibility.

A larger monitor size is useful in viewing a larger picture. The monitor size is measured in terms of its diagonal length in inches. (Figure 1.9).

19 inch

Figure. 1.9 : Monitor Size

Monitor technology

Monitors can be classified into the following types according to the technology used by them:

²CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) Monitor ²LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) Monitor ²LED (Light Emitting Diode) Monitor

12For free distribution

CRT monitor

LCD /LED monitor

Fig.1.10 : CRT and LCD /LED monitor

CRT monitors consume more electricity than the other two types. Further they are heavier and occupy more space due to its size. Hence, light weight LED and LCD monitors which consume less electricity are commonly used today. (See figure 1.10).

1.5.4Main memory

Let us consider a shelf which is used to keep books and bags when entering a library (See figure 1.11). Students who enter the library keep their school bags in compartments. They takes their bags as they leave the library.

In a similar manners data and instructions are stored temporarily in the main memory (See figure 1.12) when the computer functions. A bigger rack for storage in a library can hold more school bags. Similarly, a higher capacity in the main memory stores more data and instructions. Therefore, a computer with a higher main memory capacity is better.

Important - The capacity of the main memory is measured in units of bits. (Mega Bite (MB) or Giga Bite (GB) etc).

1024 MB = 1 GB

Refer to workbook for activity 1.5.

1.5.5Video Graphic Adapter (VGA)

Figure 1.13 : VGA card

The Monitor is the main output device of a computer. The output is fed to the monitor via the Video Graphic Adapter (VGA). There are two types of Video Graphic Adapter (VGAs). On board VGA is fixed to the mother board and Separate VGAs card can be fixed to mother board manually. The separate VGA card has a separate video memory and a processor. Separate VGA cards are useful for playing computer games.

Modern computers use DV1 or HDMI ports instead of VGA port (See Figure 1.14).

Figure 1.14 : Types of video ports

When HDMI cables are connected to a computer, a television screen or multi media projector, both sound and video signals are transmitted. When a VGA is used for the same purpose, only images are transmitted and a separate cable is required for sound.

1.5.6 Sound cards

Many computer are widely used for entertainment today. A sound card is required for listening to music and recording audio. A microphone connected to the sound card can be used to record (input) sounds while a speaker connected to the sound card can be used to play (output) sounds.

Most computers have the sound card built into the motherboard (See figure 1.15). A user can also connect external sound card to the computer if necessary.

Non-technical features to be considered in purchasing a computer1.6

Non-technical specifications such as manufacturer, type of book and price are considered in purchasing an exercise book. This applies to the purchase of a computer as well. Therefore, in purchasing a computer, non-technical specification must also be considered.

1.6.1Warranty

Warranty is an important factor to be considered when purchasing a computer. Warranty given by the vendor and the manufacturer assurers to cover the defects for a certain period. Customer can get this warranty in many different ways.

a. Manufacturer warranty

The warranty which is given by the manufacturing company is known as the manufacturer warranty. If the device malfunctions during the warranty period, it is either repaired or replaced with a new one.

b. Extended warranty

Extended warranty is a prolonged warranty given to customers in addition to the standard warranty. Customer needs bearing additional cost for extended warranty.

c. On-site warranty

If a customer obtains an on-site warranty, technicians from the respective company visit the place of work to repair the product. They generally maintain, replace faulty parts and examine the operations of the machine.

There is a standard warranty when purchasing a computer. but, the warranty for the parts of the computer may differ from the standard.

For instance, a laptop computer with standard warranty for 3 years, may have only one year warranty for the battery.

1.6.2Price

The price of a computer can vary according to the customer requirements.

e.g.

1. The price of a computer is rather high with a high speed processor.

2. A computer with a large monitor is comparatively high in price.

3. Price is low of a computer with a lesser memory capacity.

4. A computer inclusive high capacity hard disk drive is high in price.

It is advisable to compare prices to suit one’s requirements from different places and select the computer with the lowest price.

Refer to workbook for Activities 1.6 and 1.7

Important - It is not advisable to purchase a computer considering only its price.

1.6.3 Services after-sale

Computer sales centers provide the following after-sales services to customers;

1. Technical advice

2. Technical assistance

3. Telephone, e-mail and website information (i.e. contact information) of the vendor

It is advisable for a user to consider the given information in purchasing a computer. Customer needs preparing specifications first. Then, a computer must be bought from a vendor with a reputed name and must be from a recognized manufacturer.

In the above, a number will be displayed if one of the five conditions is satisfied or if non of the five conditions is satisfied.

Control structure with repetition 3.3

Repetition is about an action getting repeated again and again.

With repetition, both beginning and end is based on a condition.

Example 1 Displaying numbers 1 - 5

Flowchart 3 : Display numbers 1 - 5

End

Yes

NoIs the number 5 or less than 5?

Show number

Number = 1

Add 1 to number

In this flowchart the condition is, “Is the number equals 5 or less than 5”?

At the beginning, condition is checked and since the condition is true, the repetitive work commences.

Once the number is shown, 1 is added to it and the condition is checked again.

When the number exceeds five, condition is not satisfied and the repetition ends.

Programming with arrays3.7

What is an array?

In Grade 7, we learnt that to store values in programming, variables are needed. We need a number of variables that is equivalent to the number of values to be stored.

For example, consider storing marks gained by a student for five question papers on general knowledge.

Five variables are required to store marks for the five question papers.

Name the variable as marks _ 1, marks _ 2, marks _ 3. marks _ 4 and marks _ 5. Marks earned by a student can be stored in these variables. Consider 78, 85, 69, 93, 87 to be the marks scored.

marks_1

78

marks_2

85

marks_3

69

marks_4

93

marks_5

87

Each variable needs giving a name when variables are used to store values. This is difficult when a large number of variables are used. Further, the program become complicated and large with large number of variables. In such instances, arrays are used to get over this problem.

An array is a data structure that can store any number of items using a single variable name. By using arrays, programs become less complex and the number of instructions can be reduced.

Building up arrays

Lists are used for arrays in Scratch. Lists can be built as follows in Scratch.

e.g. - Using arrays to enter names of animals:

1. Select ‘Make a List’ from data

2. Give array a name

3. Select ‘For this sprite only’

4. Click 'OK'

Displaying items in an array

After entering data into an array named ‘Country’, the following program can be used to display its content to produce the output.

Scratch program 14

In the above program, v_con is a variable and ''Country'' is the name of the array.

Let us consider an example where two Scratch programs to store the names and the marks of five students are processed. The first one uses multiple variables whereas the second one uses two arrays.

Note - An array is termed a list in Scratch programming. Let us consider another example;

A school conducted a competition to select students for a general knowledge contest. The principal decided to select students who gained over 15 marks for the interview.

Five students are to face the interview. In the code shown below, using two arrays named 'Name' and 'Marks' the names of students having marks greater than 75 are shown.

Note - Microcontroller

A micro controller is actually a chip design to perform some operations according to the given instructions. Components of microcontroller

A microcontroller consists of four basic components;

1. Central Processing Unit - CPU

This processes data into information in order to provide the output.

2. Memory

There are two types;

i. Non-volatile memory

The data in the non-volatile memory does not get erased even if there is no electricity. The program that the microcontroller should execute is stored in it.

ii. Volatile memory

Data in the volatile memory gets erased if there is no electricity. It functions as the Random Access Memory (RAM). This is used to store data as well as other results that are related when the microcontroller is at work. Data and instructions for the CPU are also held here.

3. System clock

The system clock is an electronic device. It synchronizes all components.

4. Peripheral devices

Small pins used to input data or output information belong to this category. Data is collected in both in analog and digital forms. Output is released in digital form.

Use of sensors and micro controllers

Solar lamp

This contains solar cells, sensors and microcontroller. Solar cells microcontroller and light sensors cooperate to light the lamp. The solar lamp turns on automatically with the dark and turns off when there is light. Use of such solar lamps can minimize the waste of electricity.

Washing machine

Pressing buttons, the user gives instructions to the microcontroller for the wash. The microcontroller operates accordingly.

Microwave oven

The microcontroller in the microwave oven holds the heat for a specified period and stops. The user has to instruct regarding the required temperature and the duration.
