Message from the Hon. Minister of Education

The past two decades have been significant in the world history due to changes that took place in technology. The present students face a lot of new challenges along with the rapid development of Information Technology, communication and other related fields. The manner of career opportunities are liable to change specifically in the near future. In such an environment, with a new technological and intellectual society, thousands of innovative career opportunities would be created. To win those challenges, it is the responsibility of the Sri Lankan Government and myself, as the Minister of Education, to empower you all.

This book is a product of free education. Your aim must be to use this book properly and acquire the necessary knowledge out of it. The government in turn is able to provide free textbooks to you, as a result of the commitment and labour of your parents and elders.

Since we have understood that the education is crucial in deciding the future of a country, the government has taken steps to change curriculum to suit the rapid changes of the technological world. Hence, you have to dedicate yourselves to become productive citizens. I believe that the knowledge this book provides will suffice your aim.

It is your duty to give a proper value to the money spent by the government on your education. Also you should understand that education determines your future. Make sure that you reach the optimum social stratum through education.

I congratulate you to enjoy the benefits of free education and bloom as an honoured citizen who takes the name of Sri Lanka to the world.

Akila Viraj KariyawasamMinister of Education

Being innovative, changing with right knowledgeBe a light to the country as well as to the world.

Foreword

You are born in a country, which is renowned as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. Even though your country appeared to be small when compared to other countries, its worth is incomparable. You who are born in such a treasured and estimable country are truly fortunate. It is our sole expectation that as students, you would enlighten the future world by educating yourselves well and by becoming virtuous citizens. In order to help realize that expectation, the government takes all necessary measures to provide all the facilities free of charge. This textbook is offered to you as one step of that process.

According to the primary curriculum, new textbooks for grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 have already been introduced. Following the introduction of new textbooks for grade 5 in 2020, the revision of the primary curriculum will be concluded. There are about 30 textbooks offered by the government to students studying in grades 1 to 5. It’s your responsibility to strive towards enlightening your life through the usage of this treasure.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial and writer boards as well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department who have strived to offer this textbook to you.
