New Seven Wonders of the World Chosen

The Great Wall of China, Rome’s Colosseum, India’s Taj Mahal and three architectural constructions from Latin America were among the new seven wonders of the world. “About 100 million votes were cast by the Internet and mobile text messages,” according to New 7 Wonders, the nonprofit organization that conducted the poll.

The chosen seven beat 14 other nominated landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower, Easter Island in the Pacific, the Statue of Liberty, the Acropolis, Russia’s Kremlin and Australia’s Sydney Opera House. Almost 200 nominations came in, and the list was reduced to the 21 most-voted. The Colosseum, the Great Wall, Machu Picchu, the Taj Mahal and Petra had been among the leading candidates since January 2007, while the Statue of Christ Redeemer received an increase in votes more recently.

The campaign to name new wonders was launched in 1999 by the Swiss adventurer Bernard Weber. Weber’s Switzerland-based foundation aims to promote cultural diversity by supporting, preserving and restoring monuments. adapted from :- http://www.washingtonpost.com

One day a ladybird was getting ready for breakfast. She was expecting a houseguest. Just as she began heating up the frying pan for pancakes, the doorbell rang. She took the frying pan off the stove and went to answer the door. As she opened the door, sunshine spilled in through the doorway. The sunshine actually made the carpet look a different colour. “Welcome,” she said to her houseguest. “I’m glad you could come by for breakfast.” Ladybird opened the door wide. “Come in and have a seat.” she said. The ladybird went to the linen closet and pulled out her finest tablecloth. She spread the tablecloth on the table and set out her teapot beside the vase of sunflowers. The ladybird and her houseguest sat down and had a delicious breakfast together.
