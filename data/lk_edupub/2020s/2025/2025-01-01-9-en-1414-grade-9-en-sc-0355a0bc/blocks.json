This results the stimulation of the nerve endings at the cochlea. \u00b2This auditory impulse is carried to the brain by the auditory nerve and the relevant part of the brain interpret the sound. This is known as hearing. \u00b2The semi-circular canals contribute to maintain the balance of the body. \u00b2Hardening of ossicles, impaired hearing and deafness are some disorders of hearing. \u00b2The range of audibility of the human ear is between 20 Hz - 20 000 Hz. \u00b2The sounds of higher intensities may damage the ear. \u00b2Necessary precautions must be followed to protect the ear.",
