Message of the Boards of Writers and Editors

This textbook has been compiled in accordance with the new syllabus which is to be implemented from 2015 for the use of grade six students.

We made an effort to develop the attitude “We can master the subject of Mathematics well” in students.

In compiling this textbook, the necessity of developing the basic foundation of studying mathematical concepts in a formal manner was specially considered. This textbook is not just a learning tool which targets the tests held at school. It was compiled granting due consideration to it as a medium that develops logical thinking, correct vision and creativity in the child.

Furthermore, most of the activities, examples and exercises that are incorporated here are related to day to day experiences in order to establish mathematical concepts in the child. This will convince the child about the importance of mathematics in his or her daily life. Teachers who guide the children to utilize this textbook can prepare learning tools that suit the learning style and the level of the child based on the information provided here.

Learning outcomes are presented at the beginning of each lesson. A summary is provided at the end of each lesson to enable the child to revise the important facts relevant to the lesson. Furthermore, at the end of the set of lessons related to each term, a revision exercise has been provided to revise the tasks completed during that term.

Every child does not have the same capability in understanding mathematical concepts. Thus, it is necessary to direct the child from the known to the unknown according to his / her capabilities. We strongly believe that it can be carried out precisely by a professional teacher.

In the learning process, the child should be given ample time to think and practise problems on his or her own. Furthermore, opportunities should be given to practise mathematics without restricting the child to just the theoretical knowledge provided by mathematics.

Our firm wish is that our children act as intelligent citizens who think logically by studying mathematics with dedication.

12 Rectilinear Plane Figures

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,

● identify the properties of the rectilinear plane figures triangle, rectangle, square, trapezium and parallelogram.

12.1 Plane figures Let us first consider a plane. The surface of a blackboard, a kitchen table and a notice board lies on a plane.

Now, let us recall about line segments.

The following figures denote a straight line segment and a curved line segment.

A straight line segment A curved line segment

In mathematics, figures drawn on flat surfaces using straight line segments and curved line segments are defined as plane figures. Given below are some plane figures.

Ball

Since the surface of a ball is not flat, a figure drawn on a ball's surface is not a plane figure.

For free distribution2

12.2 Closed plane figures and open figures

Plane figures such as the following three figures which are completely bounded by line segments are defined as closed plane figures.

Plane figures such as the following figures which are not completely bounded by line segments are called open figures.

Exercise 12.1

(1) Select the closed plane figures from the following figures and write down the corresponding letters.

12.3 Rectilinear plane figures

Given below are some examples of closed figures bounded by straight line segments only. Such figures are called closed rectilinear plane figures.

This figure is not closed. Therefore, even though it contains straight line segments only, it is not a closed rectilinear plane figure.

This figure contains curved lines. Therefore, even though it is closed, it is not a closed rectilinear plane figure.

Exercise 12.2

12.5 Triangles and quadrilaterals

Next, let us look at closed rectilinear plane figures drawn with three straight line segments and drawn with four straight line segments in detail.A closed rectilinear plane figure drawn with three straight line segments is defined as a ''triangle''.

A triangle has three sides and three angles.

A closed rectilinear plane figure drawn with four straight line segments is defined as a ''quadrilateral''.

A quadrilateral has four sides and four angles.

For free distribution5

In a quadrilateral, there are two pairs of sides which do not meet each other. Such a pair of sides is defined as a pair of opposite sides.

The pair of sides in red is one pair of opposite sides. The other pair of opposite sides is shown in blue.

• Various types of quadrilaterals and their properties

It is possible to distinguish acute angles, right angles and obtuse angles by using a right angled corner. Also, when a rectilinear plane figure has been drawn on a square grid, the length of a side and the gap between opposite sides can be found by counting the number of squares (appropriately).

In the above quadrilateral,

² the length of each side in blue is 9 squares. ² the length of each side in red is 7 squares. ² all angles are right angles. ² the gap between the pair of sides in blue is 7 squares. ² the gap between the pair of sides in red is 9 squares.

For free distribution6

Now let us engage in an activity and identify various types of quadrilaterals and their properties.

By using a right angled corner and by counting squares or by some other method such as using a string, establish that the given properties of the following rectilinear plane figures are correct.

Activity 1

(1) Trapezium Properties: • The gap between one pair of opposite sides is constant.

13 Decimals

By studying this lesson, you will be able to, ● recognize decimal numbers,● compare decimal numbers and ● add decimal numbers having two decimal places.

13.1 Introduction to decimals

When we divide 1 into 10 equal parts, one part is equal to 110' We learnt this in the lesson on fractions.Likewise, 1 is ten 110s.

The coloured quantity is 1

10 .

11 is ten 1

10 s.

Another way to write 1

10 is 0.1. That is, 0.1 = 110

We read 0.1 as “zero point one”.

Likewise, 210 is two 110s. That is, 0.2 = 210

0.2 is read as “zero point two”.

So" and90.9.

Each of the digits in a whole number occupies a place. We learnt about this in the lesson on place value.

Let us now name the places occupied by the digits in each of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9.

In these numbers, the place where 0 is written is the ones place. The dot that appears after 0 is called the decimal point. The place of the digit that appears soon after the decimal point is called the first decimal place. The place value corresponding to the first decimal place is 110.

Let us consider the number 0.5.

The figure below shows the place each digit in 0.5 occupies. These places are indicated by squares.

2.5 = Two ones + Five 110s 2.5 = 2 + 0.5

Let us represent 2.5 using the abacus.

OnesTenths

The ones place of 2.5 is occupied by 2. The value represented by 2 is two ones, that is, two. The first decimal place of 2.5 is occupied by 5. The value represented by 5 is five. That is or 0.5.

13.2 More on introduction to decimals

When we divide 1 into 100 equal parts, one part is 1

100. We learnt this in the lesson on fractions.

Ten 1

10s is 1.1100Ten s is .1100

110

For free distribution13

Using decimal places,

1100 is written as 0.01. That is 0'01 = 1

100.

We read 0.01 as "zero point zero one".

Likewise, four 1

100 s is 4100 . Using decimal places

4100 is written as 0.04.

We read 0.04 as "zero point zero four".

Let us consider 27100.

27100 = 20100 + 7100 = 210 + 7100 = Two 110s + Seven 1

100s = 0.2 + 0.07

Using decimal places, we write 27100 as 0.27. We read 0.27 as "zero point two seven".

Let us represent 0.27 on an abacus.

13.3 Comparison of decimals

Comparison of decimals using fractions

110 = 0'1= 0'2

We know

110< . We learnt this in the lesson on fractions.That is, 0.1 is less than 0.2.

For free distribution17

Let us now try to find the greater number from 0.7 and 0.5.

710

510= 0.7 and= 0.5

Since 710 > 510 , 0.7 > 0.5.

That is 0.7 is greater than 0.5.

Let us compare 1 and 0.8.

and 0.8 =

= 0'8 = 1 Since , we have 1'0 > 0'8

That is 1 is greater than 0.8.

Let us compare 2 and 1.8.

1'8

2

From the figure, it isclear that 2 > 1.8.

So far we have learnt how to compare parts of ten. Let us now learn

how to compare parts of hundred.

Let us compare 0.23 and 0.52.

0'23 = 23

100 and 0.52 =

52100

.

Since 23100 < 52100 , we have 0.23 < 0.52. That is 0.52 is greater than 0.23.

Let us compare 0.3 and 0.32.

and .

To compare 310 and 32100 , we need to express them as fractions having

the same denominator.

310 = 3

10

30100 10

10 = ××

For free distribution18

That is, is a fraction equivalent to 310.

Since 3010032100 < , we get 0.30 < 0.32

That is, 0'3 < 0'32

●Another method of comparing decimals

We can compare decimals using the values of its digits.

When comparing two decimal numbers the number having the greater whole number part, is the greater number of the two. If both numbers have the same whole number part, then we need to compare the digits in their decimal places.

Then the number having the greater digit in the first decimal place is the greater number of the two. If both numbers have the same digit in the first decimal place, then we need to compare the digits in the second decimal place. Then the number having the greater digit in the second decimal place is the greater number of the two.

Example 1

Write down the numbers 4.15, 3.76 and 3.52 in ascending order.

Of these three numbers, the number with the greatest whole number part is 4.15. Therefore the greatest number out of the given three numbers is 4.15.

The whole number parts of both 3.76 and 3.52 are the same. So let us compare the digits in the first decimal place.

In 3.76 the digit in the first decimal place is 7. In 3.52 the digit in the first decimal place is 5. Since 7 > 5, we have 3.76 > 3.52.

Therefore the above numbers written in ascending order is 3.52, 3.76, 4.15.

For free distribution19

Example 2

Find the greater number from 8.76 and 8.72.

The whole number parts of both 8.76 and 8.72 are the same. The digit in the first decimal place of both numbers is 7. So let us compare the digit in the second decimal place.

In 8.76, the digit in the second decimal place is 6. In 8.72, the digit in the second decimal place is 2. Since 6 > 2, we have 8.76 > 8.72. Therefore, the greater number is 8.76.

Example 3

Write down the numbers 0.3, 0.33 and 0.03 in ascending order.Since 0.3 = 0.30, let us consider 0.30, 0.33 and 0.03.

● The whole number parts of all these numbers are equal.

● The number with the smallest digit in the first decimal place is 0.03, and therefore, it is the smallest.

● The digit in the first decimal place of 0.33 and 0.30 is the same. Of these two, 0.33 is the one with the greater digit in the second decimal place. Therefore, 0.33 > 0.3

● Therefore, 0.03, 0.30, 0.33 are in ascending order.

Exercise 13.3

(1) Out of each pair of numbers below, write down the greater number.

(i) 0.1 and 0.5 (ii) 0.06 and 0.6 (iii) 2.35 and 2.53 (iv) 3.05 and 3.51 (v) 7.1 and 7.09 (vi) 2.58 and 5.21

(iii) 0.04, 4, 4.04, 0.44 (iv) 1.31, 1.33,3.13, 3.03

13.4 Adding decimal numbers

Let us add 0.3 and 0.2.

This figure represents one unit divided into 10 equal parts.

represents 1

10, that is 0.1.

represents , that is 0.2 and

represents

310, that is 0.3.

Therefore,

+=210

310

510

0'2 + 0'3 = 0'5

0.2 and 0.3 can be added in the following way.

0.2+ 0 .3

0.5

As shown, the two numbers are written in such a way that the digits corresponding to each place are aligned in the same column and the decimal points are also aligned in one column. Once the two numbers are written down in this manner, we can add the digits in the same place separately.

Summary

● In a decimal number, the place occupied by the digit that appears just after the decimal point is the first decimal place.

● The place occupied by the digit that appears just after the first decimal place is the second decimal place.

● Decimal numbers can be compared either by writing them as fractions or by comparing the values of the digits in the corresponding places of the two numbers.

● When adding and subtracting decimals, the mathematical operation should be performed by considering for each number, the value represented by the digit in each of the places of the number.

14 Types of Numbers and Number Patterns

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,

● identify odd numbers, even numbers, prime numbers, composite numbers, square numbers and triangular numbers among the whole numbers and

● identify number patterns formed by the above types of numbers.

14.1 Even numbers and odd numbers

Let us identify even numbers and odd numbers among the whole numbers.

Six pens can be equally divided between Nimali and Vimali in the following manner.

Number of pens Nimali receivedNumber of pens Vimali received

No remainder

This shows that, if the quantity is 2, 4, 6 or 8, then it can be divided into two equal parts without a remainder. That is, these numbers are divisible by 2. Numbers such as 2, 4, 6 and 8, which when divided by 2 have zero remainder, are called even numbers. 0 is also an even number.

When a whole number is divided by 2, if the remainder is zero, then the number is an even number.

Accordingly, even numbers starting from zero can be written as 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...

From the above information we see that when the number of pens is 3 or 5, then the pens cannot be divided equally between Nimali and Vimali. When an equal number of pens are given to both, then in the end, there is one remaining.

Numbers such as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11, which when divided by 2, have a non-zero remainder, are called odd numbers.

For free distribution28

When a whole number is divided by 2, if the remainder is one, then the number is an odd number.

Accordingly, odd numbers starting from one can be written as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, ...

²When the two even numbers 2 and 6 are added, the result is 8, which is also an even number. When we add any two even numbers in this manner, the result is also an even number. ²We can verify the following statements by using the examples.

²When two odd numbers are added together, the result is an even number. ²When an even number and an odd number are added together, the result is an odd number.

²When an even number is subtracted from an even number, the result is an even number. ²When an odd number is subtracted from an odd number, the result is an even number.

²When an odd number is subtracted from an even number, the result is an odd number.

²When an even number is subtracted from an odd number, the result is an odd number.

²When two odd numbers are multiplied together, the result is also an odd number. ²When any whole number is multiplied by an even number, the result is an even number.

●Identifying even numbers and odd numbers by considering the digit in the ones place.

Let us consider another method of finding out whether numbers like 2157 and 34 826 are odd numbers or even numbers without dividing the number by 2.

For free distribution30

Now let us consider several whole numbers. Let us write each of them using the numbers its digits represent.124 = 100 + 20 + 4 230 = 200 + 30 + 0 395 = 300 + 90 + 5 761 = 700 + 60 + 1 842 = 800 + 40 + 2 2157 = 2000 + 100 + 50 + 7 34 826 = 30 000 + 4000 + 800 + 20 + 6The numbers represented by the digits in the tens place, hundreds place and the thousands place of any whole number given above, are multiples of 10. Therefore, those numbers are divisible by 2 (without a remainder). So, if the digit in the ones place is divisible by 2, (with zero remainder) then the given number is divisible by 2.

If the ones place of a number has one of the digits 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8 then the number is an even number.

If the ones place of a number has one of the digits 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9 then the number is an odd number.

Each of the numbers 4, 6, 8 and 9 has more than two different factors.

For free distribution32

Whole numbers greater than one such as 2, 3, 5 and 7 which have exactly two distinct factors are called prime numbers. Let us now write the prime numbers from 1 to 20.They are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 and 19.

Of these prime numbers only 2 is even. All the others are odd.

Apart from 2, all the other even numbers have more than two factors. Therefore, of all prime numbers, 2 is the only even prime number.

Whole numbers such as 4, 6, 8 and 9 which have more than two distinct factors are called composite numbers.

Therefore whole numbers greater than one, other than prime numbers are called composite numbers. 1 is neither a prime nor a composite number.

The number of pipes in each row from the top is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. By adding these numbers, the total number of pipes is obtained as 21. Therefore 21 can be represented using dots, where the dots are placed in a triangular formation.

Let us find out about such numbers that can be represented using dots, arranged in a triangular formation.

Some measuring tools that are used to measure lengths are shown below.

Look at your 15 cm ruler. The sixteen long lines with equal gaps between them are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, .... 15. The gap between every two long lines is again divided into 10 similar parts using short lines.

The distance between each two long lines on the ruler is 1 centimetre.The distance between each two short lines is 1 millimetre.

That is, one centimetre is 10 millimetres.One centimetre is written as 1cm, and 1 millimetre is written as 1 mm. So, 10 mm = 1cm

Look at the metre ruler and measuring tapes of different lengths that are given to you. You will notice that in those tools also there are numbers such as 0, 1, 2… and lines. Check carefully as to how many centimetres are marked on the metre ruler. You will notice that it has numbers marked from 0 centimetres to 100 centimetres. The length of a hundred centimetre is one metre. One metre is written as 1 m.That is 100 cm = 1 m

The ruler having a length of one metre is called the metre ruler. Check carefully as to how many metres are marked on a measuring tape.

Now you can identify measuring tapes of different lengths.

The distance between two towns or the length of a highway is measured in kilometres. A length of 1000 metres is one kilometre. One kilometre is written as 1 km.

That is 1000 m = 1 km

15.4 Relationships between the different units of measuring length

We have learnt that millimetre, centimetre and metre are some units that are used to measure length. Now let us discuss the relationships between these units.

• Relationship between a millimetre and a centimetre

By observing the 15 cm ruler you identified that a length of 10 millimetres is indicated as one centimetre.

For free distribution46

10 mm = 1 cm

Therefore,

In the lesson on decimals you learnt that

110 0.1=. Therefore , 1 mm = 0.1 cmNow let us consider how we express a length given in centimetres, in terms of millimetres. Since 1 cm = 10 mm, 2 cm = 20 mm 3 cm = 30 mmTo express the length given in centimetres in terms of millimetres, the number of centimetres needs to be multiplied by ten. Now let us consider how we express a length given in millimetres in terms of centimetres. Since 10 mm = 1 cm, 20 mm = 2 cm 30 mm = 3 cmTo express the length given in millimetres in terms of centimetres, the number of millimetres needs to be divided by ten.

Express 8 cm, in millimetres.8 cm = 8 × 10 mm = 80 mm

Express 60 mm in centimetres.

Express 27 mm in centimetres and millimetres.27 mm = 20 mm + 7 mmSince 10 mm = 1 cm, 20 mm = 2 cm 27 mm = 2 cm + 7 mm 27 mm = 2 cm 7 mm

Express 0.7 cm in millimetres. 1 cm = 10 mm 0.1 cm = 1 mm 0.7 cm = 7 mm

Express 35 mm in centimetres.

Express 5.3 cm, in millimetres. 5.3 cm = 5 cm + 0'3 cm Since 5 cm = 50 mm and 0.3 cm = 3 mm, 5.3 cm = 50 mm + 3 mm = 53 mm

In Parami’s pencil box, there are several pencils. The length of the red pencil is 13.3 cm. The length of the blue pencil is 138 mm. The length of the yellow pencil is 12 cm 8 mm.Out of these pencils, which one is the longest? Explain your answer. Let’s write the lengths of the 3 pencils in the same unit. The length of the red pencil = 13'3 cm = 13 cm + 0'3 cm = 130 mm + 3 mm = 133 mm The length of the blue pencil = 138 mm The length of the yellow pencil = 12 cm 8 mm = 120 mm + 8 mm = 128 mmSince 138 is the largest number out of 133, 138 and 128, the blue pencil is the longest pencil.

² Relationship between a centimetre and a metre.

When we observe a tape or a metre ruler, we see that a length of 100 cm is 1 m.

Since 

Since 1100 = 0.01, 1 cm = 0.01 m

Now let us consider how we express a length given in metres, in terms of centimetres. Since 1 m = 100 cm" 2 m = 200 cm 3 m = 300 cm

Accordingly, to express a length given in metres in terms of centimetres, the number of metres needs to be multiplied by 100.

For free distribution50

Now let us express a length given in centimetres, in terms of metres.Since 100 cm = 1 m" 200 cm = 2 m 300 cm = 3 m Accordingly, to express a length given in centimetres in terms of metres, the number of centimetres needs to be divided by 100

Express 54 cm in metres.

54 cm = 54100 m

Since 54100 = 0.54,

54 cm = 0.54 m

Accordingly, to express a length of 100 cm or more, in terms of metres and centimetres the number of centimetres is written as lesser than 100.

² The relationship between a metre and a kilometreNow let us express a length given in kilometres in terms of metres. Since 1 km = 1000 m, 2 km = 2000 m 3 km = 3000 m Accordingly, to express a length given in kilometres in terms of metres, the number of kilometres needs to be multiplied by 1000.

Now let us express a length given in metres, in terms of kilometres.

Since 1000 m = 1 km, 2000 m = 2 km 3000 m = 3 km Accordingly, to express a length given in metres in terms of kilometres, the number of metres needs to be divided by 1000.

This type of calculation is needed when we arrange bricks around a flower bed, build a wall around a plot of land and construct a frame for a picture. The perimeter of a plane figure is the sum of the lengths of the sides of that figure. Let us find the perimeter of plane figures.The picture below shows a wall hanging. A ribbon has to be sewn around it. Let us find the length of this ribbon. The length of this ribbon = 68 cm 7 mm + 68 cm 7 mm + 60 cm 4 mm

68 cm 7 mm

60 cm 4 mm

68 cm 7 mm

Let us find out how to add these numbers.

cm mm 68 7 68 7 + 60 4 197 8

Step 1 - Let us add the numbers in the millimetre column separately.

7 mm + 7 mm + 4 mm = 18 mm' 18 mm = 10 mm + 8 mm = 1 cm + 8 mm Let us write 8 mm in the millimetre column. Let us carry the 1 cm to the centimetre column.

Step 2 - Let us add the numbers in the centimetre column. 1 cm + 68 cm + 68 cm + 60 cm = 197 cm

So the length of the ribbon is 197 cm and 8 mm.

20 m 75 cm

12 m 60 cmA certain ground has a rectangular shape (See figure). Its length is 20 m 75 cm and its width is 12 m 60 cm. We need to find the perimeter of the ground.

First, let us add the two lengths together.

m cm 20 75 + 20 75 41 50

Let us add the numbers in the centimetre column. It is 75 cm + 75 cm = 150 cm 150 cm = 100 cm + 50 cm 150 cm = 1 m + 50 cm

Let us write the 50 cm in the centimetre column. Now let us add the 1 m we obtained here to the numbers in the metre column. 1 m + 20 m + 20 m = 41 m

So the sum of the two lengths is 41 m 50 cm.Similarly let us add the two widths.

m cm 12 60 + 12 60 25 20

We need to add the two lengths and the two widths to find the perimeter.

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,● identify the units used to measure quantities of liquids,● identify the relationship between millilitres and litres,● add and subtract measurements of liquid amounts expressed in terms of millilitres and litres and● estimate quantities of liquids.

16.1 Introduction

The different types of liquids that you bring from the shop are filled in bottles of various sizes. Several such bottles are depicted in the figure. Observe the quantities that are mentioned on the bottles.

The quantity of liquid contained in each bottle has been expressed in millilitres or in litres. Let us write the quantities mentioned on the bottles as follows.

Forty millilitres has been expressed as 40 ml using symbols, Three hundred and fifty milliliters has been expressed as 350 ml using symbols, andone litre has been expressed as 1 l using symbols.

Litres and millilitres are units used to measure quantities of liquids.The quantity of milk in a milk packet or the quantity of medicinal syrup in a bottle is usually measured in millilitres, while the fuel used in vehicles is measured in litres.

Activity 1

16.2 Relationship between the units used to measure amounts of liquid

We have learnt that the units millilitres (ml) and litres (l) are used to measure amounts of liquids. A quantity of 1 litre of a liquid is equal to a quantity of 1000 ml of the liquid.1 l = 1000 ml

Step 1- Find vessels of the following sizes.

Activity 2

Step 2 - Fill the 500 ml vessel completely with water and pour it into the 1 l vessel. How many times has the 500 ml vessel to be filled completely with water to fill the 1 l vessel completely? Step 3 - Fill the 250 ml vessel completely with water and pour it into the 1 l vessel. How many times has the 250 ml vessel to be filled completely with water to fill the 1 l vessel completely?

Step 4 - Similarly, how many times must water be poured from a completely filled 200 ml vessel to fill the 1 l vessel completely?Step 5 - How many times must water be poured from a completely filled 100 ml vessel to fill the 1 l vessel completely?

The results you will obtain by doing this activity are given below.

● The 1 l vessel is filled completely when water is poured into it twice from a completely filled 500 ml vessel. There are two 500 ml amounts in 1 l. Accordingly,

500 ml500 ml

500 ml + 500 ml = 1 l That is, 1000 ml = 1 l

● The 1 l vessel is filled completely when water is poured into it four times from a completely filled 250 ml vessel. That is, there are four 250 ml amounts in 1 l.

250 ml + 250 ml + 250 ml + 250 ml = 1 l

250 ml

250 ml250 ml250 ml

That is, 1000 ml = 1 l ● The 1 l vessel is filled completely when water is poured into it five times from a completely filled 200 ml vessel. That is, there are five 200 ml amounts in 1 l.

●Representing liquid measurements expressed in litres in terms of millilitres

The amount of millilitres in certain amounts of litres is given below. Since 1 l = 1000 ml, 2 l = 2000 ml 3 l = 3000 ml

Accordingly, to express a quantity of liquid given in litres, in terms of millilitres, the number of litres has to be multiplied by 1000.

Express 1 litre 200 millilitres in millilitres.

1 l 200 ml = 1 l + 200 mlSince 1 l = 1000 ml, 1 l 200 ml = 1000 ml + 200 ml = 1200 ml

4 l 85 ml = 4 l + 85 ml Since 1 l = 1000 ml, 4 l 85 ml = 4000 ml + 85 ml = 4085 ml

Express 4 l 85 ml in millilitres.

Express 12 l in millilitres. 12 l = 12 × 1000 ml = 12 000 ml

16.3 Adding liquid measurements

Let us find out the quantity of drink that is obtained when 350 ml of fruit juice is added to 750 ml of water.

These liquid measurements can easily be added together since they are both expressed in the same units.

Quantity of fruit juice = 350 mlQuantity of water = 750 ml Total quantity = 1100 ml

That is, the total quantity of drink is 1 l 100 ml.

Accordingly, to express an amount of 1000 millilitres or more, in terms of litres and millilitres, the amount of milliliters is written as lesser than 1000.

A producer of cinnamon oil produced 2 l 750 ml of oil during the first week and 5 l 500 ml of oil during the second week. Let us find out how much oil he produced during the two weeks.

Let us add these measurements by writing the millilitres in one column and the litres in another column, as shown below.

l ml 2 750 + 5 500 8 250

Let us add the quantities in the millilitres column.750 ml + 500 ml = 1250 ml Since 1250 ml = 1 l + 250 ml,

let us keep the 250 millilitres in the millilitres column and carry the 1 litre to the litres column. Let us add the quantities in the litres column. We obtain 1 l + 2 l + 5 l = 8 lThat is, the quantity of oil that was produced during the two weeks is8 l 250 ml.

The quantity of oil that was produced during the two weeks can also be found in the following manner.

Let us express each quantity in millilitres and add them as follows.

2 l 750 ml = 2750 ml5 l 500 ml = 5500 ml 8250 ml

16.4 Subtracting a liquid measurement from a given liquid measurement

There was 750 ml of water in Sumith’s water bottle. He drank 150 ml of it. Let us find how much water there is in the bottle now.Quantity of water in the bottle initially = 750 ml Quantity of water Sumith drank = 150 ml Quantity of water remaining = 750 ml - 150 ml = 600 ml

The quantity of drink in a bottle in a refrigerator was 2 l and 100 ml. Of this amount, 200 ml was served to a guest. Let us find the amount of drink remaining in the bottle. Initial quantity of drink = 2 l 100 ml Quantity served to the guest = 200 ml

For free distribution69

Let us subtract the quantity that was served from the quantity that was initially there.

2 l 100 ml is equal to 2100 ml. Now let us 2100 ml - 200 ml 1900 ml subtract 200 ml from 2100 ml.

That is, the remaining amount is 1 l 900 ml.The remaining amount can also be found in the following manner.

l ml 2 100 - 200 1 900

100 is smaller than 200.Let us carry 1 l to the millilitres column. There is 1 l remaining in the litres column.Then there is 1000 ml + 100 ml, that is, 1100 ml in the millilitres column.1100 ml - 200 ml = 900 mlTherefore, the remaining amount is 1 l 900 ml.

18 Algebraic Symbols

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,

● identify known terms, unknown terms and variables.

18.1 Symbols used in maths

There are many symbols which are used in mathematics that you are aware of. For example, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are ten symbols that you know very well. These symbols of the Hindu Arabic System are defined as digits. All the numbers are written using these ten digits.

Several numerals that can be written using only the digits 1 and 2 are given below. For example, twenty two is denoted by 22 and two hundred and twenty one is denoted by 221.

1, 11, 12, 21, 22, 111, 112, 121, 122, 211, 212, 221, 222

Several other symbols which are used in mathematics are given below.

Mathematical operation SymbolAddition+Subtraction−Multiplication×Division÷

Mathematical expressions can be written using symbols such as 1, 2, 3, +, − , ×, ÷, =.

For example, the statement that thirteen is obtained by adding five to eight can be expressed using symbols as 8 + 5 = 13.

The statement “three twos is six” can be expressed as 2 × 3 = 6 and “two threes is six” can be expressed as 3 × 2 = 6 using symbols.

For free distribution91

Example 1

Let us find the total number of litres of milk that are purchased during a week by a household which purchases two litres of milk each day.

The solution to this problem can be expressed as 2 × 7 = 14 using symbols.That is, the quantity of milk purchased during a week by the household is 14 l.

2 l

Symbols are used when solving a problem with the knowledge of mathematics. In this case, it is necessary to translate statements which have been expressed in words into mathematical statements using symbols before the problem is solved.

18.2 Symbols used to denote known and unknown terms

We know that there are seven days in a week. This is also written as “7 days in a week”.

In this example, the symbol 7 has been used to express the fact that a week has seven days. This is a constant number which we know. Therefore it is defined as a known term.

A known constant value can be expressed using a symbol as above. These constant values are called known terms.

In mathematics, a constant value which is known, that is a known term, is expressed by a number.

Suppose a certain household buys the same amount of milk each day. If this amount is not known, we cannot express it using a number. Such constant values which are not known are defined as unknowns.

For free distribution92

An unknown term in a mathematical expression is most often represented by a simple letter of the English alphabet. Accordingly, since the amount of milk purchased each day is an unknown constant value, we can denote it using the letter a.

Look at the way Nimal and Sita show us how many olives they each have in their hand.

The number of olives that are in Sita’s hand can be written using the numerical symbol “3”. It is a known number. However we cannot say definitely how many olives there are in Nimal’s hand. This is an unknown constant value. That is, it is an unknown term.

Accordingly, let us take the number of olives that are in Nimal’s hand to be b. Note that we may use any other letter we like as well, instead of b.

The symbols used to denote unknown terms as above are algebraic symbols.

Several instances when algebraic symbols are used to denote unknown constants are given below.

 The length of your classroom is l metres.  The number of books in your school library is n.  The height of the flag pole is h metres.

(ii) In the 3rd column write down its value by digits if it is a known constant and a suitable algebraic symbol if it is an unknown constant.

ExpressionKnown/Unknown

 The number of days in January The number of books in Nimal’s school bag The number of millilitres in one litre The number of words in the Grade 6 mathematics textbook.  The number of times you took a breath yesterday.

18.3 Variables

It should be clear to you from the above figure, that there are coconuts of various prices to be sold at the market. Therefore, since the selling price of a coconut does not take a fixed value, we say that the price of a coconut is a variable.

For free distribution94

Such variables are denoted using English letters such as x, y, z, … These too are algebraic symbols.

Example 1

The daily revenue of a certain shop is Rs x.The distance a vehicle travels during an hour is y km.The distance travelled by a vehicle on one litre of petrol is x km.The number of days in the month of February is n.

Exercise 18.2

(i) The number of players in a netball team

(ii) The number of bananas in the first comb of a cluster of bananas

(iii) The time taken for a jet to travel from the Katunayake International airport to the New Delhi airport

(iv) The number of sides of a square

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,

● construct algebraic expressions using algebraic symbols,● find the value of an algebraic expression containing one unknown of coefficient 1, by substituting a whole number for the unknown term.

19.1 Constructing algebraic expressions

Sunimal has 5 exercise books and Chathura has 4 exercise books. Let us find the number of exercise books that the two of them together have.

The number of exercise books the two of them together have is 5 + 4; that is 9.

Chalani had 4 exercise books. She received a parcel containing exercise books from her uncle. Now let us find the amount of exercise books she has.

Four booksParcel

Since the number of books in the parcel is not known, it is an unknown constant. Let us represent the number of books in the parcel by n.

The number of books that Chalani originally possessed = 4 The number of books in the parcel she received from her uncle = n The total number of books Chalani now possesses = 4 + n

“The total number of books Chalani now possesses” is written as 4 + n. This can also be written as n + 4.

Expressions such as the above which contain an algebraic symbol are called algebraic expressions.

Let us construct an algebraic expression for another situation.

5 marbles are removed from a bag of marbles. Now let us construct an algebraic expression for the number of marbles that are remaining in the bag.

Number of marbles is aLet us take the number of marbles that were in the bag to be a. This is an unknown constant.

Number of marbles that were in the bag = a Number of marbles that were taken out of the bag = 5 Number of marbles remaining in the bag = a – 5

An algebraic expression denoting the number of marbles remaining in the bag is a – 5.

Example 1

There are 45 students in a class. If the number of boys in the class is taken to be m, construct an algebraic expression for the number of girls in the class.

To find the number of girls in the class, the number of boys in the class needs to be subtracted from the total number of students in the class. Total number of students in the class = 45Number of boys in the class = mNumber of girls in the class = 45 - m

(8) The price of a coconut is Rs x. A mother has Rs 150 in her hand. If the price of a coconut is less than the amount in her hand she buys a coconut how much money will be remaining?

19.2 Substitution

Let us consider the algebraic expression x + 6. Here, x represents a number. Suppose x = 2. Then x + 6 = 2 + 6 x + 6 = 8When x = 2, the value of the algebraic expression x + 6 is 8.

Assigning a numerical value to an unknown term or a variable in an algebraic expression is called substitution. By substitution, an algebraic expression receives a numerical value.

Now, let us find the values that the algebraic expression x + 6 takes when we substitute various values for x.

When x = 2, x + 6 = 2 + 6, = 8

When x = 4, x + 6 = 4 + 6, = 10

When x = 8, x + 6 = 8 + 6, = 14

20 Mass

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,

●identify the units used to measure mass,

●identify the relationship between the different units of mass and

●add and subtract masses given in terms of these units.

20.1 Introduction

The following figure depicts packets of tea leaves of different quantities which are found in the market. Observe the quantity that is written on each of the packets.

You may notice that the amount of tea leaves in each packet has been given in grammes (g) or kilogrammes (kg).

These quantities can be described as follows.

●The quantity of tea leaves in the first packet is 50 grammes.50 grammes has been denoted by 50 g. ●The quantity of tea leaves in the second packet is 500 grammes.500 grammes has been denoted by 500 g. ●The quantity of tea leaves in the third packet is 1 kilogramme.1 kilogramme has been denoted by 1 kg.

Now let us investigate the meaning of mass. The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in the object. Accordingly, the mass of the tea leaves in the packet with 50 g written on it is 50 g. Similarly the mass of the tea leaves in the other two packets are 500 g and 1 kg respectively.

The mass of the bag of rice is 50 kilogrammes; that is, 50 kg.

Grammes and kilogrammes are two units that are used to measure mass.

When we purchase items from the market, most often the quantities we buy are measured in grammes and kilogrammes.

The following figure depicts several standard weights and a balance scale which are used to measure mass.

A balance scale (weighing scale) is used to measure the mass of an object by comparing it with the mass of one or more standard weights.

How 1 kg of potatoes is measured using a 1 kg standard weight is shown below. The standard weight that is used to measure the quantity is placed in one of the pans while the object is placed in the other pan.

Quantity of potatoes is less than 1 kg

Quantity of potatoes is more than 1 kg

For free distribution103

The beam is horizontal.

When the beam of the scale is horizontal, the scale is balanced. Then the mass of potatoes in the pan is 1 kg.

Two 200 g standard weights can be used to measure 400 g of flour.

When a 500 g standard weight and a 100 g standard weight are available, 400 g of flour can be measured as depicted in the following figure.

500 g standard weightFlour and 100 g standard weight

20.2 Various instruments that are used to measure mass

When a balance scale and standard weights are used, most often, amounts which are equal in mass to one or more standard weights are measured. The balance scale and standard weights shown on page 102 cannot be used to find the actual mass of an item such as a pumpkin of mass 425g. In such a situation one of the instruments shown here can be used.

A 1 kg standard weight has been placed in the left side pan of each of the following balance scales and the scale has been balanced by placing wooden blocks of equal mass in the right side pan. Write down the mass of a wooden block in each scale.

There are two wooden blocks. There are 4 wooden blocks. Mass of a wooden block = …… Mass of a wooden block = ….

There are 10 wooden blocks. Mass of a wooden block =…………Let us see whether the masses you obtained are correct.

(i) Since 1 kg is 1000 g, the mass of the 2 wooden blocks is 1000 g. Therefore, the mass of one block is 500 g.

(ii) Since 1 kg is 1000 g, the mass of the 4 wooden blocks is 1000 g. Therefore, the mass of one block is 250 g.

(iii) Since 1 kg is 1000 g, the mass of the 10 wooden blocks is 1000 g. Therefore, the mass of one block is 100 g.

●Express a mass given in kilogrammes in terms of grammes.

Now let us consider how we express the mass of an object which has been given in kilogrammes, in terms of grammes.

Since 1 kg = 1000 g, 2 kg = 2000 g 3 kg = 3000 gAccordingly, to express a mass given in kilogrammes, in terms of grammes, the given number of kilogrammes needs to be multiplied by 1000.

Example 1Example 2

Express 7 kg in grammes.

Since 1 kg = 1000 g, 7 kg = 7 × 1000 g = 7000 g

Express 1 kg 250 g in grammes.

Since 1 kg = 1000 g,1 kg 250 g = 1000 g + 250 g = 1250 g

20. 4 Adding masses

Let us find the mass of the mixture that is obtained when 250 g of sugar is added to 500 g of “Thriposha”.

500 g250 g750 g

Both the masses have been given in grammes. Since both masses have been given in the same unit let us add them as shown here.

The mass of the mixture is 750 g.1 kg 500 g of flour, 1 kg 250 g of sugar and 1 kg 500 g of margarine are mixed together to prepare a cake.

For free distribution109

Let us find out what the mass of the mixture is.

When adding these masses which have been given in terms of

kilogrammes and grammes, it is necessary to write the kilogrammes in one column and the grammes in a different column.

kg g 1 500 1 250 1 500 4 250 +

Let us add the values in the grammes column.500 g + 250 g + 500 g = 1250 g1250 g = 1000 g + 250 g Since 1000 g = 1 kg, 1250 g = 1 kg + 250 gLet us write the 250 g in the grammes column.Let us carry the 1 kg to the kilogrammes column. Then the sum of the values in the kilogrammes column is, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 , which is 4. That is, 4 kg. Therefore, the answer is 4 kg 250 g.

Example 1

Let us add the amounts in the grammes column.750 g + 450 g = 1200 g1200 g is 1 kg and 200 g.Let us write the 200 g in the grammes column.Let us carry the 1 kg to the kilogrammes column.Then the sum of the values in the kilogrammes column is,1 + 2 + 1, which is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4 kg 200 g.

20.5 Subtracting masses

A housewife left 2 kg 750 g of black peppers that she had obtained from her garden, out in the sun to dry for several days. When she weighed it again she found that the mass had reduced to 1 kg 200 g. Let us find the quantity by which the mass had reduced during the drying process.

For free distribution111

kg g 2 750 - 1 200

1 550

To find the amount by which the mass had reduced during the drying process, the mass of the dried peppers has to be subtracted from the mass of the fresh peppers. To do this, let us write them one below the other, such that the gramme values are in one column and the kilogramme values are in another column.

By subtracting we obtain 1 kg 550 g. Therefore, the mass of the peppers has reduced by 1 kg 550 g during the drying process.

Example 1

Since 750 g cannot be subtracted from 250 g, let us convert 1 kg into grammes and add it to the 250 g.Then 1000 g + 250 g = 1250 gNow, 1250 g – 750 g = 500 gThere is only 1 kg remaining in the kilogramme column now. Therefore, the mass of the biscuits in the box is 1 kg 500 g.

The mass of a box containing biscuits is 2kg 250 g. If the mass of the empty box is 750 g, find the mass of the biscuits in the box.

21.1 Introduction to ratio

Fruit juiceWater

Shown above is a label of a fruit juice bottle. It illustrates that a certain amount of fruit juice should be mixed with five equal amounts of water. Accordingly, six bottles of fruit drinks can be prepared by mixing one part of fruit juice with five parts of water.

The number of male workers and female workers who work in an office can be compared numerically.

There are many instances where we have to compare the quantities of certain things or to compare the amounts of several quantities.

The following are some examples.

²A cement mixture is made by mixing certain amounts of cement and sand. ²When making cakes, flour and sugar are mixed together.

²To make a concrete mixture, metal, sand and cement have to be mixed together. ²The number of girls and boys in a school can also be considered.

Let us consider a mixture that we make by mixing several ingredients together.

Irrespective of the amount of the mixture, very often we have to maintain its composition throughout the mixture. In such instances we have to know the relationship between the quantities of ingredients we have to mix. For this reason it is necessary to express all ingredients using the same unit.

The same mixture of the above mentioned fruit juice can also be prepared in the following ways.

1 l fruit juice bottle

1 glass of fruit juice

5 glasses of water

5 l Water bottle

In this instance though the unit used to measure the quantities is bottle or glass or litre, one unit of fruit juice has been mixed with five units of water.

A ratio is a numerical relationship between the amounts of two or more quantities that have been represented using the same unit (as in the above case). Further, a ratio is also a numerical relationship between the amounts in two groups which are being compared.

For free distribution116

Accordingly, the ratio of the above fruit juice to water is said to be one to five. This can be symbolically expressed as 1 : 5. Here " : " is known as the symbol of ratio. 1 and 5 are the terms. When written as 1 : 5, the first term is 1 and the second is 5. As a ratio does not change with the units used to measure the quantities, it is not necessary to indicate the unit here.

Now let us consider another example.

A person spends 7 rupees and saves 3 rupees from each 10 rupees of his earnings. Let us find the ratio of what he spends to what he saves. Here the quantities are savings and spendings that are expressed in the same unit, rupees. Accordingly, the ratio of spendings to savings is 7 : 1.

Another example is that of making paint of a certain colour by mixing paints of different colours.

Let us consider making light blue paint by mixing one part of dark blue paint with two parts of white paint .Accordingly, the ratio of the amounts of dark blue to white paint is 1:2.

The following table shows how to make light blue paint by mixing different quantities of white and dark blue paint in the ratio 1 : 2.

21.2 Equivalent ratios

A concrete mixture is made with cement and sand according to the ratio 1 : 3. Accordingly, the number of parts of sand that should be used when the number of parts of cement is changed is shown in the table below.

1 : 3 2 : 6 (1 : 3 is multiplied by 2)3 : 9 (1 : 3 is multiplied by 3)4 : 12 (1 : 3 is multiplied by 4)5 : 15 (1 : 3 is multiplied by 5)

The table shows, 1 : 3 = 2 : 6 = 3 : 9 = 4 : 12 = 5 : 15In the above example, the ratio of sand to cement can be written in any one of the forms 1 : 3, 2 : 6, 3 : 9. All these are equivalent ratios.

Accordingly, a ratio equivalent to a given ratio can be obtained by multiplying each term of the ratio by the same number (greater than zero).

Example 1

Write down two ratios equivalent to 2 : 5.Multiplying the terms of the ratio by 2,2 : 5 = 2 × 2 : 5 × 2 = 4 : 10Multiplying the terms of the ratio by 3,2 : 5 = 2 × 3 : 5 × 3 = 6 : 152 : 5 = 4 : 10 = 6 : 154 : 10 and 6 : 15 are two other ratios equivalent to 2 : 5.

● Another method for finding equivalent ratios

Let us consider a mixture made of 2 l of lime juice mixed with 4 l of water. In this mixture, the ratio of lime juice to water is 2 : 4.The same composition can be obtained by mixing 1 l of lime juice with 2 l of water.

Hence the ratios 2 : 4 and 1 : 2 are equivalent ratios.

The ratio 1 : 2 can be obtained by dividing the terms of 2 : 4 by 2.Hence 242: 4 : = 1 : 222=

Accordingly, a ratio equivalent to a given ratio can be obtained by dividing each term of the ratio by the same number (except zero).

21.3 Writing a ratio in its simplest form

Let us consider some ratios equivalent to each other.8 : 12 = 4 : 6 = 2 : 3 = 6 : 9 = 10 : 15

A ratio is in its simplest form when both terms are whole numbers and there is no whole number which both terms can be divided by.

So 2 : 3 is the simplest form of the ratio 8 : 12.The ratio 2 : 3 is the simplest form of 4 : 6, 6: 9 and 10 : 15 as well.

To write in its simplest form, keep dividing both sides of the ratio by the same number until you can't go any further without going into decimals.

21.4 Rate

The picture shows that two table - spoons of milk powder have to be added to make a cup of tea. Here, as the amount of tea and milk powder that should be added cannot be expressed in the same unit, the amounts of tea and milk powder to be mixed cannot be expressed as a ratio. Consider the following.

• 10 eggs are used to make 1 kg of cake.

• A vehicle can travel 12 km on 1 l of oil.

• The price of 10 guavas is Rs. 100.

The two quantities in each of the above situations are measured in different units. Rate is a relationship between such quantities.

Let us consider some other instances where rate is used.

(1) Price of a pencil is Rs. 10.

(2) Rs. 40 is charged to travel 1 km in a vehicle.

(3) Students present at a function received 3 biscuits each during the interval.

(4) The price of a match box is Rs. 50.

The relationship between two currencies of different countries is a rate. The value of a United States dollar in Sri Lanka was Rs. 130.54 on 11.03.2014. Such a relationship between different currencies is called exchange rate. Since the exchange rate changes daily, we need to write the date when mentioning the exchange rate.

A representation of data such as the above is called as a picture graph. Number of data represented by a symbol in the picture graph should be indicated.

The number of popsicles sold by an ice cream seller on 5 days of a certain week is given in the following table. Represent this data by a picture graph.

Let us consider how this data can be represented in a picture graph. Initially, a suitable symbol should be selected, and the number of popsicles each symbol represents has to be decided.

Let us select the symbol . Next, let us decide how many popsicles this symbol represents.

If one popsicle is represented by the symbol , we would have to draw 144 of these symbols to denote 144 popsicles. Since this is not possible, we represent several popsicles by one symbol.

Let us consider the numbers which divide each of the above numbers without remainder. The above numbers are divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12. If 2 popsicles are represented by one symbol, 72 symbols have to be drawn to denote 144 popsicles. This too is not possible. It is more appropriate to represent 12 popsicles by , since a large value can then be represented by a small number of symbols.

To find the number of symbols required to denote the number of popsicles sold each day, the number of popsicles sold each day has to be divided by 12.

The number of children training for several events to be held at a certain school inter-house sports competition is given below.

Represent this data in a picture graph.We need to first decide on a suitable symbol to represent this data, as well as to decide on the number of children each symbol represents.

First, let us decide on the number of children that are to be represented by one symbol, and then decide on a picture accordingly.

From these numbers, the numbers 144, 60 and 48 are divisible by 4, 6 and 12. Let us consider whether it is suitable to select the largest of these numbers which is 12.

●The number of symbols required to denote track games= 144 ÷ 12 = 12 ●The number of symbols required to denote field games = 90 ÷ 12 = 7 with a remainder of 6. Here 6 is exactly half of 12. ●The number of symbols required to denote netball = 60 ÷ 12 = 5 ●The number of symbols required to denote volleyball = 42 ÷ 12 = 3 with a remainder of 6. Here 6 is exactly half of 12. ●The number of symbols required to denote cricket = 48 ÷ 12 = 4

23 Data Interpretation

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,

● interpret the data represented in picture graphs and tables.

23.1 Interpreting data represented in tables

We learnt how data is represented in picture graphs and tables in the lesson on Data Collection and Representation.

Drawing various information from the data represented in picture graphs and tables is known as data interpretation.

Let us consider the data represented in tables.

The following table provides data on the sales of 175 ml bottles of fruit juice marketed by a company during the first five months of the year 2014.

Month Number of Bottles

January30 000February32 100March31 500April 34 800May33 000

To draw various conclusions regarding these sales, let us answer the following questions according to the above table.

(i) How many more bottles were sold in February than in January? Number of bottles sold in February = 32 100 Number of bottles sold in January = 30 000 Therefore the number of extra bottles sold in February }= 32 100 - 30 000

= 2 100

(ii) Considering the months of March and April, what was the total sales during these two months?

Number of bottles sold in March = 31 500 Number of bottles sold in April = 34 800 Total number of bottles = 31 500 + 34 800 = 66 300

(iii) Considering these five months, during which month were sales highest and during which month were sales lowest? What was the quantity of sales during these two months?

Sales were highest in April. The number of bottles sold during this month was 34 800.

Sales were lowest in January. The number of bottles sold during this month was 30 000.

(iv) Write down the ratio of the number of bottles sold in January to the number sold in May in its simplest form.

Number of bottles sold in January = 30 000 Number of bottles sold in May = 33 000Ratio of the number of bottles sold in January to the number sold in May}= 30 000 : 33 000

= 30 000 ÷ 1000 : 33 000 ÷ 1000= 30 : 33= 30 ÷ 3 : 33 ÷ 3= 10 : 11Exercise 23.1

24 Indices

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,

● recognize the index notation● write a number as a power of another number and● expand a power and write its value.

24.1 Index notation

In mathematics there are instances when a number has to be multiplied repeatedly and written.

In the lesson on factors you wrote 16 = 4 × 4In the same manner we can write 16 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2

There is a method of writing a number which is multiplied repeatedly as above in a concise way.

In the following table the first few examples show how a number which is multiplied repeatedly is written in a concise way. After understanding the method, fill in the blanks in the other examples.

Activity 1

When a number which is multiplied repeatedly is written in the above manner in a concise way, we say that it is written using indices or that it is written in index form.

For free distribution148

2 × 2 × 2 is written using indices as 23.

The fact that 2 is multiplied three times over in this product is indicated by the small digit 3 written at the top, on the right hand side of 2.

In 23, 2 is defined as the base and 3 is defined as the index.This is read as two to the power three (or two to the power of three).

23 index

base The value of 23 is equal to the value of 2 × 2 × 2. That is, its value is 8.

A number to the power two is also called the square of the number. Example: Five to the power two, or 52, is also five squared.

A number to the power three is also called the cube of the number. Example: Eight to the power three, or 83, is also eight cubed.

24.2 Representing a number as a power of a given number

To express the number 16 as a power of 2, it is necessary to know how many times 2 should be multiplied by itself to obtain the value 16.

16 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2

That is, 16 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 24 It is easy to use division to find the number of times a particular number should be multiplied to obtain a given number. In the above example, when the base is identified as 2, to find the index, the number 16 should be divided repeatedly by 2.

25 Area

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,●identify the amount of space occupied by a surface as its area,●measure the area using arbitrary units,●recognize cm2 as a unit of measurement of area,●measure the areas of squares and rectangles using a 1 cm × 1 cm square grid and ●create figures of given area using 1 cm2 square laminas.

25.1 Identifying what area is

The space allocated for six students to display their creations on a wall newspaper is shown in the figure.

AkilaKavinduGihan

Wall Newspaper

KamalawathiNazeerAshen

The space allocated to each student can be identified as a surface which is bounded by line segments. The space occupied by a surface is known as its area. Observe the amount of space each student has been allocated.

We can easily say that the space allocated to Kavindu on the wall newspaper is more than the space allocated to Akila because both have been allocated similar shaped spaces.

That is, Kavindu has been allocated a space with a larger area than the area of the space Akila has been allocated.

25.2 Measuring the area using arbitrary units

Step 1 - Cut out a square shaped lamina of side length 6 cm from a piece of cardboard.

Step 2 - By taking the area of the lamina to be 1 unit, determine how many units the area of the following surfaces are by placing the lamina on each of them.

1. The front page of your mathematics textbook.2. The front page of your mathematics exercise book.3. The top surface of your desk.

Step 3 - Cut out a rectangular shaped lamina of length 8 cm and breadth 3 cm from a piece of cardboard.

Step 4 - As before, find the area of the above surfaces using this lamina.

The figure illustrates how a student has placed a rectangular shaped lamina on a page of his mathematics exercise book to determine the area of the lamina.

Let us take the area of the square which has been shaded in red as one unit. Then the area of the rectangular lamina is 24 of these units.

This figure illustrates how another student has placed the same rectangular lamina on a new square grid of a different size to find its area.

Let us take the area of the square which is shaded green as 1 unit. Then the area of the rectangular lamina is 6 of these units.
