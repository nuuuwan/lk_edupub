Message of the Boards of Writers and Editors

This textbook has been compiled in accordance with the new syllabus which is to be implemented from 2017 for the use of grade eight students.

We made an effort to develop the attitude “We can master the subject of Mathematics well” in students.

In compiling this textbook, the necessity of developing the basic foundation of studying mathematical concepts in a formal manner was specially considered. This textbook is not just a learning tool which targets the tests held at school. It was compiled granting due consideration to it as a medium that develops logical thinking, correct vision and creativity in the child.

Furthermore, most of the activities, examples and exercises that are incorporated here are related to day to day experiences in order to establish mathematical concepts in the child. This will convince the child about the importance of mathematics in his or her daily life. Teachers who guide the children to utilize this textbook can prepare learning tools that suit the learning style and the level of the child based on the information provided here.

Learning outcomes are presented at the beginning of each lesson. A summary is provided at the end of each lesson to enable the child to revise the important facts relevant to the lesson. Furthermore, at the end of the set of lessons related to each term, a revision exercise has been provided to revise the tasks completed during that term.

Every child does not have the same capability in understanding mathematical concepts. Thus, it is necessary to direct the child from the known to the unknown according to his / her capabilities. We strongly believe that it can be carried out precisely by a professional teacher.

In the learning process, the child should be given ample time to think and practice problems on his or her own. Furthermore, opportunities should be given to practice mathematics without restricting the child to just the theoretical knowledge provided by mathematics.

We would like to bestow our sincere thanks on Dr. Jayampathi Rathnayake, Department of Mathematics, University of Colombo.

Our firm wish is that our children act as intelligent citizens who think logically by studying Mathematics with dedication.

15 Decimal Numbers

By studying this lesson you will be able to, ²multiply a whole number by a decimal number, ²multiply a decimal number by a decimal number, ²divide a whole number by a decimal number, and ²divide a decimal number by a decimal number.

15'1 Decimal numbers

In Grades 6 and 7 you learnt how to represent a given fraction as a decimal number and a given decimal number as a fraction.

You also learnt that it is easy to represent a fraction as a decimal number when the denominator of the given fraction can be expressed as a power of 10 such as 10, 100, 1000, ... etc.

¾ Let us consider how a fraction with denominator equal to 10 is written as a decimal number.

110 = 0'1" 910 = 0'9" 1710 = 1'7

¾ Let us now recall how some fractions with denominators which are not powers of 10 were represented as decimal numbers by using equivalent fractions.

² Let us write 325 as a decimal number. ² Let us write 77125 as a decimal number.

Since 100 ÷ 25 = 4" Since 1000 ÷ 125 = 8"

325 = 3 × 425 × 4 = 12100 = 0'12 77125 = 77 × 8125 × 8 = 6161000 = 0'616

² Let us write the improper fraction 174 as a decimal number.² Let us write the mixed number 33406 as a decimal number.

174 = 17 × 254 × 25 = 425100 = 4'25 33406 = 6 + 33 40 = 6 + 33 × 2540 × 25

= 6 + 8251000

= 6 + 0'825

= 6'825

Accordingly, if a number which is a power of 10, such as 10, 100, 1000, is divisible by the denominator of a fraction, then that fraction can easily be written as a decimal number.

You have learnt how to multiply a decimal number by a whole number and how to divide a decimal number by a whole number.

¾ When multiplying a number which is in decimal form by a number which is a power of 10, the number of places the decimal point in the decimal number is shifted to the right (by adding zeros if necessary), is equal to the number of zeros in the power of ten by which it is multiplied.

Examples: (i) 3'211 × 10 = 32'11 (ii) 2'31 × 100 = 231 (iii) 1'11 × 1000 = 1110

¾ When dividing a number which is in decimal form by a number which is a power of 10, the number of places the decimal point in the decimal number is shifted to the left (by adding zeros if necessary) is equal to the number of zeros in the power of ten by which it is divided.

Examples: (i) 22'31 ÷ 10 = 2'231 (ii) 0'4 ÷ 100 = 0'004 (iii) 32 ÷ 1000 = 0'032

15' 2 Multiplying a whole number by a decimal number

Let us now study how to multiply a whole number by a decimal number. This is similar to multiplying a decimal number by a whole number. We can also convert the decimal number into a fraction and then perform the multiplication.

² Let us find the value of 7 × 0'8

Let us write the decimal number as a fraction with denominator a power of 10 and then multiply. 0'8 = 810

∴ 7 × 0'8 = 7 × 810 = 7 × 810 = 5610 = 5'6 That is, to obtain the value of 7 × 0'8" the value of 7 × 8 needs to be divided by 10.

∴ 7 × 0'8 = 5610 = 5'6

² Let us find the value of 8 × 1'2

Method I8 × 1'2 = 8 × 1210 = 8 × 1210

= 9610

= 9'6

Since 1.2 × 10 = 12, to obtain the value of 8 × 1.2, the value that is obtained for 8 × 12, by not considering the decimal place in 1.2, should be divided by 10.That is, 8 × 1.2 = 9.6

Method IILet us first multiply the numbers without considering the decimal places.

8 × 12 = 96Since there is one decimal place in 1.2, place the decimal point in the answer such that it too has one decimal place.

That is, 8 × 1'2 = 1'2 × 8 = 9'6

Find the value of 8 × 8'73'Method I8 × 8'73 = 8 × 873 100 = 8 × 873100 = 6984100 = 69'84

That is, to find the value of 8'73 × 8" the value of 873 × 8" must be divided by 100.

Method IILet us multiply the two numbers without considering the decimal places. 873 × 86984

Since 8.73 has two decimal places, the decimal point needs to be placed in the answer such that it too has two decimal places.∴ 8 × 8'73 = 69'84

(i) 7 × 233 = 1631 (ii) 7 × 233 = 1631 Since 2'33 × 100 = 233" 7 × 2'33 = 1631 ÷ 100 = 16'31

Since 23'3 × 10 = 233" 7 × 23'3 = 1631 ÷ 10

= 163'1

ª (iii) 7 × 233 = 1631 Since 0'233 × 1000 = 233" 7 × 0'233 = 1631 ÷ 1000 = 1'631

15' 3 Multiplying a decimal number by a decimal number

The length and breadth of a rectangular shaped bed sheet are 2.7 m and 0.9 m respectively. Find the area of the bed sheet.

Length of the rectangular shaped bed sheet = 2'7 m

Breadth of the rectangular shaped bed sheet = 0'9 m

∴ Area of the rectangular shaped bed sheet = 2'7 m × 0'9 m

= 2'7 × 0'9 m2

Now let us consider how to find the value of 2'7 × 0'9'

Method ILet us write each decimal number as a fraction.

2'7 = 2710 and 0'9 = 910 .

∴ 2'7 × 0'9 = 2710 × 910

= 27 × 9100

= 243100

= 2'43

That is, to find the value of 2'7 × 0'9" the value of 27 × 9 must be divided by 100. Method II

2'7 × 0'9

multiplicand multiplier 27 × 9 243There are two decimal places in these two decimal numbers (multiplicand and multiplier).Let us multiply the two decimal numbers without considering their decimal places.27 × 9 = 243 When 243 is written by considering the two decimal places, we obtain 2.43. That is, 2'7 × 0'9 = 2'43Therefore, the area of the bed sheet is 2.43 m2.

15' 4 Dividing a whole number by a decimal number

Jayamini requires several pieces of ribbon of length 0.8 m each to decorate a classroom. She has a roll of ribbon of length 48 m.

Let us find how many pieces of ribbon of length 0.8 m can be cut from this roll of ribbon.

To obtain the answer, 48 m needs to be divided by 0.8 m.

Method I48 ÷ 0'8 = 48 ÷ 810

Since the reciprocal of 810 is 108

∴ 48 ÷ 0'8 = 48 × 108

= 4808 = 60

Let us find the value of 48 ÷ 0.8 without considering the decimal place in 0.8.Since 0.8 has one decimal place, the answer which is obtained for 48 ÷ 8 must be multiplied by 10. 48 ÷ 8 = 6 ∴ 48 ÷ 0'8 = 60'

Therefore 60 pieces of ribbon can be cut.

16 Ratios

By studying this lesson you will be able to, ²represent a ratio as a fraction, ²determine continued ratios, and ²solve problems involving continued ratios.

16'1 Ratios

Let us recall what you learnt about ratios in Grade 7.

You learnt that a ratio is a numerical relationship between two or more quantities which are measured in the same unit.

You also learnt when comparing two groups, that a ratio is a numerical relationship between the magnitudes of the two groups.

Consider the following example,

When preparing a concrete mixture, 1 pan of cement, 3 pans of sand and 4 pans of gravel are mixed together.

Sand

Cement

Gravel

The ratio in which cement, sand and gravel are mixed together when preparing this concrete mixture can be expressed as 1 : 3 : 4. This is read as “1 to 3 to 4”. Here, 1, 3 and 4 are the terms of the ratio.

By multiplying or dividing each term of a given ratio by a number which is greater than 0, a ratio equivalent to the given ratio can be obtained.

If the terms of a ratio are whole numbers and if the HCF of these numbers is 1, then

16'2 Representing a ratio as a fraction

The following example shows how a ratio can be expressed as a fraction by writing an equivalent ratio in which one term is equal to 1.

¾ In a race, Dilki ran 30 m in the time that Sayuni took to run 50 m. The ratio of the distance that Dilki ran to the distance that Sayuni ran is 30 : 50. This ratio written in its simplest form is 3 : 5. This means that Dilki ran 3 m in the time that Sayuni took to run 5 m.

• When we divide both the terms in the ratio 3:5 by 5 we obtain 35 : 55 = 35 : 1.This means that Dilki runs 35 m in the time that Sayuni runs 1 m. That is, when the distance run by Dilki is expressed as a fraction of the distance run by Sayuni, it is 35.

• By dividing both terms of the ratio 3 : 5 by 3, we can in a similar manner express the distance run by Sayuni as a fraction of the distance run by Dilki as 53.

• Since Sayuni runs 5 m in the time that Dilki runs 3 m, the total distance run by them during this period is 8 m. When we divide both terms in the ratio by 8 we obtain 38 : 58. This means that when the distance run by Dilki is expressed as a fraction of the total distance it is 38, and that the distance run by Sayuni is 58of the total distance.

¾ Sureni and Pradeepa shared a certain amount of money. Sureni received Rs. 35 while Pradeepa received Rs. 25. The ratio in which the money was shared between Sureni and Pradeepa can be expressed as 35 : 25.

When this is expressed in its simplest form it is 7 : 5.

The total amount shared between them = Rs. 35 + 25 = Rs. 60

... The amount received by Sureni as a fraction of the total amount = 3560 = 712

We can obtain the above fraction as shown below too.

The ratio in which the money was shared between Sureni and Predeepa = 7 : 5

The amount received by Sureni as a fraction of the whole amount = 77 + 5 = 712Similarly,the amount received by Pradeepa as a fraction of the whole amount = 512

16'3 Dividing in a given ratio

In our day to day life, there are many occasions when we have to share things with each other. Sometimes the sharing is equal while at other times it is not.

Let us recall what we learnt in Grade 7 about dividing something in a ratio.

A, B and C are three people. If Rs. 2000 was divided among them in the ratio 2 : 3 : 5, let us calculate how much each person received.

The ratio in which money is divided among them = 2 : 3 : 5

The total number of parts = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10

The amount received by A as a fraction of the whole = 210

The amount received by A = Rs. 2000 × 210

= Rs. 400

The amount received by C = Rs. 2000 × 510

²Dividing the profit when different amounts are invested for the same period of time

Sandun and Sashika started a business at the beginning of a certain year by investing Rs. 30 000 and Rs. 40 000 respectively. At the end of the year, the profit from the business was Rs. 28 000. They shared it according to the ratio in which they invested money. Let us consider how to calculate the share of the profit received by each of them.

The ratio in which Sandun and Sashika invested money = 30 000 : 40 000 = 3 : 4 The ratio in which the profit should be divided between them = 3 : 4 The total number of parts = 3 + 4 = 7

Sandun’s profit as a fraction of the whole = 37The profit from the business = Rs. 28 000Sandun’s share of the profit = Rs. 28 000 × 37 = Rs. 12 000

Sashika’s profit as a fraction of the whole = 47 Sashika’s share of the profit = Rs. 28 000 × 47 = Rs. 16 000

² Dividing the profit when different amounts are invested for different periods of time

If people invest different amounts in a business for different periods of time, both the amount invested and the period of investment need to be considered when the profit is shared.

Let us now consider such an example.

Kumudu started a business on January 1st of a certain year by investing Rs. 20 000. Sumudu joined the business by investing Rs. 30 000 two months later. At the end of the year, the profit from the business was Rs. 36 000.

Let us consider how the profit should be divided between the two of them.

Observe that in this case, the investments they made and the periods of investment are both different.

NameAmount investedPeriod of investmentAmount × PeriodKumuduRs. 20 00012 months20 000 × 12SumuduRs. 30 00010 months30 000 × 10

In such a situation, it is not fair to divide the profit by considering only the investments. Similarly, since the amounts invested are different, it is not fair to consider only the periods of investment either.

We have to consider both the investments and the periods of investment. This is done by basing the ratio in which the profit should be divided on the product of the amount invested and the period of investment (the last column of the above table). The ratio in which the profits should be divided between Kumudu and Sumudu }= 20 000 × 12 : 30 000 × 10 = 240 000 : 300 000 = 4 : 5 The sum of the parts = 4 + 5 = 9The amount Kumudu should receive = Rs. 36 000 × 49 = Rs. 16 000 The amount Sumudu should receive = Rs. 36 000 × 59 = Rs. 20 000

A fruit drink is made by mixing pineapple juice, water and mango juice. In this fruit drink, the ratio of pineapple juice to water is 1 : 3 and the ratio of water to mango juice is 3 : 2. Let us find the ratio of pineapple juice to water to mango juice in this drink.

In these two ratios, water is the common substance. It has the same value in both ratios. The ratio of pineapple juice to water = 1 : 3 The ratio of water to mango juice = 3 : 2In both cases, the term related to water is 3. ∴ the ratio of pineapple juice to water to mango juice = 1 : 3 : 2

In a concrete mixture, the ratio of gravel to sand is 5 : 3 and of sand to cement is 2 : 1. Let us consider how to find the ratio of gravel to sand to cement in the mixture.

CementSand GravelSand

In both these ratios, sand is the common substance. By making the amount of sand equal in both ratios, we can find the continued ratio of the three substances. We use “equivalent ratios” to do this.

The ratio of gravel to sand = 5 : 3 = 5 × 2 : 3 × 2 = 10 : 6The ratio of sand to cement = 2 : 1 = 2 × 3 : 1 × 3 = 6 : 3

Note

In the ratios 5 : 3 and 2 : 1, the terms corresponding to sand are 3 and 2 respectively. The least common multiple of 3 and 2 is 6. Therefore, equivalent ratios are considered such that the term corresponding to sand in both ratios is equal to 6. 5 : 3 = 10 : 6 2 : 1 = 6 : 3

Therefore, the ratio of gravel to sand to cement is 10 : 6 : 3

The ratio of gravel to sand in the concrete mixture is 5 : 3. Therefore, when 10 pans of gravel are used, 6 pans of sand are needed.

The ratio of sand to cement is 2 : 1. Therefore, when 6 pans of sand are used, 3 pans of cement are needed.

Hence the ratio of gravel to sand to cement in the mixture is 10 : 6 : 3.

Sugar is common to both ratios. The terms corresponding to sugar in these two ratios are 3 and 5. Equivalent ratios should be written such that the term corresponding to sugar is the least common multiple of 3 and 5, which is 15.The ratio of flour to sugar = 4 : 3 = 4 × 5 : 3 × 5 = 20 : 15 The ratio of sugar to coconut = 5 : 3 = 5 × 3 : 3 × 3 = 15 : 9

At the end of the year, the profit from the business was Rs. 54 000. Calculate the amount received by each of them if the profit was divided among them based on their investment and the period of investment.

Summary

When sharing profits of a joint venture, the invested amount and the period of investment are both taken into consideration. When calculating the ratio in which profits should be shared in a joint venture, the invested amount is multiplied by the period of investment. When the relationship between three quantities is given by two ratios, we obtain the continued ratio of the three quantities by considering equivalent ratios.

17 Equations

By studying this lesson you will be able to, ²construct simple equations in one unknown where the coefficient of the unknown is a fraction, ²construct simple equations using one pair of brackets, ²solve simple equations, and ²check the accuracy of the solution of a simple equation.

17'1 Equations

You have learnt that, when the value represented by an algebraic expression is equal to the value of a given number, this can be expressed as, “algebraic expression = number”.

2x + 3 = 5

You have also learnt that, when the value represented by an algebraic expression is equal to the value represented by another algebraic expression, this can be expressed as,

"first algebraic expression = second algebraic expression".

Relationships of the above forms are called equations.

2x + 3 = 5 is an equation. It has only one unknown term x, of which the index is one. Such equations are called simple equations.

2x + 3 = 5x = @

Finding the value of the unknown term for which the value of the left hand side of the equation is equal to the value of the right hand side, is called solving the equation.

The value obtained for the unknown by solving the equation, is called the solution of the equation. Simple equations have only one solution.

The above equation 2x + 3 = 5 denotes the following; "5 is obtained by adding 3 to twice the value of the unknown term".Let us recall the method of solving this equation.

(divide both sides by 2, since 2 2 = 1) 2x + 3 = 5 2x = 5 – 3 ∴ x = 1Let us check the accuracy of the solution that we obtained. When the value obtained for the unknown is substituted in the equation, if we get the same value on the left hand side of the equation as that of the right hand side, then the solution is correct.

When x = 1, the left hand side of the equation is, 2x + 3 = 2 × 1 + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 The right hand side of the equation = 5 That is, the left hand side = the right hand side. Therefore x = 1 is the correct solution of the equation 2x + 3 = 5'

² We obtain the same value on the two sides of an equation when we subtract the same number from both sides.² We obtain the same value on the two sides of an equation when we add the same number to both sides.² We obtain the same value on the two sides of an equation when we divide both sides by the same non-zero number.² We obtain the same value on the two sides of an equation when we multiply both sides by the same number.

²Construction of simple equations where the coefficient of the unknown is a fraction

Simple equations where the coefficient of the unknown is a whole number have been constructed earlier. Now let us consider how simple equations where the coefficient of the unknown is a fraction are constructed.

My brother’s age is 3 years more than one fourth of my age. He is 6 years old now. Let us construct an equation by using this information. Let x be my age in years.

Then, one fourth of my age = 14 × x = x4Since my brother’s age is 3 years more than one fourth my age,

My brother's age = x4 + 3

Since my brother is 6 years old, x4 + 3 = 6

²Constructing simple equations using one pair of brackets

By adding a certain amount of money to the 8 rupees I gave Kasun, he bought 26 olives at the price of two fruits per rupee.Let us construct a simple equation with this information to find the amount Kasun spent to buy the olives.

Let x rupees be the amount Kasun spent. Then the total amount spent to buy the olives = x + 8 rupeesThe total number of olives that can be bought šfor x + 8 rupees at the price of two fruits per rupee = 2^x + 8&

It is necessary to use brackets here because the total amount, which is x + 8 rupees, needs to be multiplied by 2.We express the fact that the sum of the two terms x and 8 is multiplied by 2, as 2 × ^x + 8&" by using brackets. The number of olives that were bought is 26. Therefore, 2 ^x + 8& = 26

Example 1

Nimali plucked some mangoes from the tree in her garden, saved 16 for herself, and by selling the rest at 25 rupees each, made 875 rupees.Construct a simple equation with this information, to find the total number of mangoes that Nimali plucked.

Let x be the total number of mangoes that were plucked.The number of mangoes that were sold = x - 16 To find the amount of money she received by selling the mangoes at 25 rupees per fruit, (x – 16) should be multiplied by 25.This amount is 25 ^x - 16&'As the amount received by selling the mangoes is 875 rupees, 25^x - 16& = 875'

18'1 Expressing a fraction as a percentage

You learnt in Grade 7 that the symbol “%” is known as the percentage sign.

The coloured region of the figure is 41 of the whole figure; that is, 10025 of the whole figure.

You have learnt that this is 25%, as a percentage of the whole figure. It is read as twenty five percent. Expressing it as such is called, expressing a portion of a whole as a percentage.

A fraction can be expressed as a percentage by writing an equivalent fraction with denominator 100.

We can write the coloured region as a percentage of the whole figure as shown below. 41 × 100% = 25%,

As 41 = 0'25" the coloured region of the figure is 0.25 of the whole figure. As a percentage it is, 0'25 × 100% = 25% '

By multiplying a given decimal number or fraction by 100%, that decimal number or fraction can be expressed as a percentage.

18'3 Ratios and percentages

“8% of the eggs in the basket are rotten”. This means that 100 such eggs would contain 8 rotten eggs. Accordingly, the ratio of the number of rotten eggs to the total number of eggs is 8 : 100. You learnt this in Grade 7.

²Writing a ratio corresponding to a percentage

Now let us see how to write the ratio corresponding to the percentage, 30%.30% can be written as 30 : 100.

30 ( 100 = 30 ÷ 10 ( 100 ÷ 10 = 3 ( 10'

Accordingly, the ratio corresponding to the percentage 30% is 3 ( 10'

²Writing a percentage corresponding to a ratio

Now let us see how to express the ratio 1 : 4 as a percentage.

The percentage corresponding to a given ratio can be found by writing the equivalent ratio with 100 as its second term.1 : 4 = 1 × 25 : 4 × 25 = 25 : 100

Since the ratio 25:100 can be written as 10025 , the percentage corresponding to the ratio 1: 4 is 25%.

Accordingly, the ratio corresponding to 20% is 1 : 5.

Note: When writing a ratio, it should be expressed in its simplest form.

Example 2 Express 1221 % as a ratio'

1221 % = 1221

100 = 1221 ÷ 100 = 225 × 1001 = 20025

20025 can be written as 25 : 200. Now,

By studying this lesson you will be able to, ²identify the symbols used to denote whether an object is an element of a set or not, ²identify the null set and the symbol used to denote the null set, and ²identify the standard notation used to denote the number of elements in a set.

19'1 Introduction of sets

You learnt in Grade 7 that a set is a collection of identifiable objects. The following are examples of sets.

(i) The set of all districts in the Southern Province of Sri Lanka.

(ii) The set of odd numbers between 0 and 10.

(iii) The set of all the letters in the word 'MATARA".

You have learnt that the objects belonging to a set are called the elements of that set. Sometimes the word “members” is used instead of the word “elements”.

When we are able to list all the elements, we express the set by writing the elements within curly brackets, separated by commas.

Let A be the set of odd numbers between 0 and 10. This can be expressed as A = ™1" 3" 5" 7" 9š'

When we write a set using curly brackets, we write each element only once within the curly brackets.

Note

When selecting the base of a triangle which is not right angled, the perpendicular can be drawn without producing the base, by selecting the side which is opposite the largest angle of the triangle as the base.

The perpendicular drawn from a vertex of a triangle to the opposite side is called as the altitude and that opposite side is called as the base.

21'1 Introduction

Given below is a news item published in a newspaper.

NewsThe next ODI between England and Sri Lanka begins at 2.30 p.m. England time at Lord’s Cricket Ground and will be telecasted live. You will be able to watch this match from 8.00 p.m. onwards Sri Lankan time.

Sri lanka8'00 p.m.

England2'30 p.m.

According to the above news item, the time in Sri Lanka is 8.00 p.m. when the time in England is 2.30 p.m. on the same day.

It is clear that the time can be different in two different places on earth at the same instant.

Let us consider why the time is different at different locations in the world at the same instant.

The earth is a spherical object. Land and oceans cover its surface.

North Pole

South Pole

N

E

S

The earth completes one rotation around its axis every 24 hours. This axis is a diameter of the earth. The two end points of the axis are called the North Pole and the South Pole.

North Pole

Hemisphere

Southern

HemisphereSouth Pole

equatorCentre of the Earth

The hemisphere with the North Pole as its topmost point is called the Northern Hemisphere, and the hemisphere with the South Pole as its topmost point is called the Southern Hemisphere. The imaginary circle on the surface of the earth which separates these two hemispheres is called the Equator.

The centre of the Equator is the same as the centre of the earth. The imaginary circles on the earth’s surface which are parallel to the Equator are called lines of constant latitude. Latitude is an angle which ranges from 0o at the Equator to 90o (North or South) at the poles. It is used to specify the location of a place on earth.

Sun

Earth

When the earth rotates around its axis, the side exposed to the sun receives sunlight and hence experiences daytime while the other side experiences nighttime. Therefore, the time in different places on earth may be different at the same instant.

21'2 Longitudes

An imaginary semicircle on the surface of the earth, connecting the North Pole and the South Pole, with the same centre as the centre of the earth is called a line of longitude. Longitude is an angular distance usually measured in degrees which is used to specify the East-West position of a location. Longitudes vary from 0o to +180o eastward and from 0o to -180o westward from the 0o line of longitude which passes through Greenwich, England.

Note The line of longitude which passes through Greenwich, England is called the Greenwich Meridian. The longitude along this line is 0o.

The longitudes between 0o and +180o, east of the Greenwich Meridian are called eastern longitudes and the longitudes between 0o and -180o, west of the Greenwich Meridian are called western longitudes.

Eastern hemisphereWestern hemisphere

0o

The hemisphere with the eastern longitudes and the hemisphere with the western longitudes are called the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere respectively.

For example, the longitude 23o due east of longitude 0o is written as 23oE and the longitude 105o due west of longitude 0o is written as 105oW.

The time taken by the earth to make one complete rotationš(360o ) around its axis = 1 day = 24 hours = 24 × 60 minutes

The time to rotate 1o = 24 × 60360 minutes

= 4 minutes

The time at any location situated on a particular line of longitude is the same.

The time difference between two locations which are 1o of longitude apart from each other is 4 minutes. For example, the time difference between the lines of longitude 20oE and 21oE is 4 minutes.

One rotation of the earth around its axis means a movement of 360o. The earth takes 24 hours for it. ∴ the number of degrees the earth rotates in an hour = 360o

NoteThe time difference between 1o of longitude is 4 minutes. It takes 1 hour for the earth to rotate 15o. Therefore, the earth is divided into 24 times zones where each time zone is bounded by two lines of longitude 15o apart.

When comparing the time in the Eastern Hemisphere with the Greenwich Meridian Time, the time increases by 4 minutes per degree of longitude, because the sun rises earlier in the east due to the rotation of the earth from west to east. Similarly, the time in the Western Hemisphere decreases by 4 minutes per degree of longitude, from the Greenwich Meridian Line towards the west.

21'3 Local time

The time at different locations in the world is calculated based on the longitude of the location and the time along the Greenwich Meridian. This is called the local time of that location. Assume that Colombo is located at longitude 80oE. Let us find the local time in Colombo when Greenwich time is 6:00.

The time difference for 15o of longitude = 1 hourThe time difference for 80o of longitude = 115 × 80 hours

= 5 13 hours

= 5 hours and 20 minutesSince Colombo is located east of the Greenwich Meridian, we have to add the above time to Greenwich time. The local time in Colombo = 06 : 00 + 5 hours and 20 minutes = 11 : 20'

If Batticaloa is considered to be situated at longitude 81o E, we can obtain the local time in Batticaloa as 11:24 when Greenwich time is 6:00 by using the fact that an increase of 1o of longitude results in an increase in time of 4 minutes, or by calculating the time as above. 21'4 Standard time based on time zones

As we have already observed, the local time can vary from one city to another city even in a small country like Sri Lanka. It is not practical to have different times at different places in the same country when the country is not too large. To avoid this situation, the earth’s surface is divided into several time zones. The time of every location within a time zone is considered to be the same at any given moment.

Except for a few special situations,

² at a given moment, every place in a particular time zone has the same time.

² the time in a time zone which is adjacent to another time zone west of it, is one hour ahead of the time in the adjacent time zone. The time in a time zone adjacent to another time zone east of it is one hour behind the time in the adjacent time zone.

² The time in Greenwich city at any particular moment is known as the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) of that moment.

² If the GMT of a particular moment is known, the time at any location in the world can easily be calculated. GMT is often used to express global time.

² • When the time in Greenwich is 11.30 a.m. on Sunday the time in the time zone +12 is 11.30 p.m. on Sunday and the time in the –12 time zone is 11.30 p.m. on Saturday (previous day). Hence the time difference between the two zones +12 and –12 is 24 hours.

² International Date Line

180oW and 180oE are the same longitude. Since the time in the zones +12 and -12 differ by 24 hours, the International Date Line (IDL) is drawn such that it avoids most of the countries so that the date in two locations of the same country will not be different.

Large countries such as the USA and Australia fall into several time zones. The time in the city of Los Angeles in the USA is 4 hours behind the time in Washington DC which is located to its east.

The difference between the time in the city of Greenwich and the time at any other place, which depends on which time zone the place is located in, is mentioned in the world map given above.

Since India, the largest country situated close to Sri Lanka belongs to both the time zones +5 and +6, the difference between Greenwich time and the time at any place in India is taken to be 5 12 hours. That is, the Indian Standard Time is 5 12 hours ahead of the GMT. Although Sri Lanka belongs to the time zone +5, Sri Lanka also considers the Indian Standard Time as the Sri Lanka Standard Time due to the ease of maintaining international connections.

3 cm

4 cm5 cm

The upper layer of the cuboid shown in the figure consists of 5 × 4 = 20 small cubes. Since there are three such layers, there are 20 × 3 = 60 small cubes.

Therefore, the volume of this cuboid is 60 cm3.

The volume of a cuboid = length × breadth × height

The volume of a cube = length × breadth × height = side length × side length × side length

When finding the volume of a cube or a cuboid, the length, breadth and height should be written in the same units.

A = a × b V = a × b × c. Let us substitute A for a × b ' Then V = A × c

Hence, the volume of the cuboid = area of the base × height

²Formula for the volume of a cube

As above, let us obtain a formula for the volume of a cube of side length a units and volume V cubic units.

Since the volume of a cube = side length × side length × side length, the formula for the volume of a cube of side length a units and volume V cubic units is, V = a × a × a V = a3

Method I

Since V = A × c" the area of the base × height = volume A × 4 = 400 ∴ A = 4004 = 100 Since the base is square shaped, the length of a side = 100 cm = 10 cmMethod IISince the base of the cuboid is square shaped, if its length and breadth are taken as a,

its volume V = a × a × c' Since V = 400 and c = 4 a × a × 4 = 400 a × a = 4004 = 100 a × a = 10 × 10 ∴ a = 10∴ the side length of the base = 10 cm

In Grade 7, you learnt that millilitres and litres are used to measure liquid amounts and that 1000 ml is equal to 1 l . Since liquids also occupy some amount of space, liquids have a volume.

The glasses A, B and C are not completely filled, but glass D is. The volume of drink in glass A is 50 ml and the volume of drink in glass D is 175 ml. The maximum amount of drink that can be poured into glass D is 175 ml. This is the capacity of glass D.

The volume of liquid that is required to fill a container completely is its capacity.

Accordingly, it is clear that the space within a container is its capacity.Litre and millilitre which are the units used to measure liquid volumes are the units used to measure capacity too. Containers used in everyday activities sometimes have their capacity indicated on them. In some cases, the amount of liquid in the container is mentioned.

²The relationship between the units of volume and capacity

There is a close relationship between the units that are used to measure volume and those which are used to measure capacity. The maximum amount of liquid that can be poured into a cube shaped container of side length 1 cm is 1 ml.

By studying this lesson you will be able to, ²identify that a circle has infinitely many axes of symmetry, ²identify what a chord of a circle is, and ²identify what an arc of a circle, a segment of a circle and a sector of a circle are.

23'1 The axes of symmetry of a circle

In Grades 6 and 7 you learnt to draw circles by using either objects with circular shapes or a pair of compasses and a pencil.

p

Step 1 - Take a sheet of paper, draw a circle and cut out the circular lamina.

Step 2 - Fold the circular lamina such that you get two equal parts which coincide with each other.

Step 3 - Mark the fold line using a pencil and a ruler.

Step 4 - Unfold the circular lamina, and as above, fold the lamina again along a different fold line to get two equal parts. Repeat this a few times and mark all the fold lines.

Step 5 - You would have observed that there are many such fold lines and that all of them pass through the same point.

A line which divides a circle into two equal parts is an axis of symmetry of that circle. From the above activity it must be clear to you that a circle has infinitely many axes of symmetry. A straight line segment joining two points which are the points of intersection of an axis of symmetry and the circle, is a diameter of the circle. The point at which the axes of symmetry of a circle intersect is the centre of the circle.

A straight line segment joining the center of a circle to any point on the circle is called a radius of the circle. The length of this line segment is independent of the point on the circle which is selected. This length is also called the radius of the circle.

24 Location of a Place

By studying this lesson you will be able to, ²express the direction of a place with respect to a particular point, based on the direction of north or the direction of south, ²sketch the location of a place with respect to a particular point, based on the direction in which it is located and the distance from the point.

24'1 Introduction

N

In Grades 6 and 7 you learnt that, when a compass is placed on a flat surface the needle points in the direction of the North. The remaining main directions, South, East and West and the sub directions Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest too can be located using a compass.

If a well and a coconut tree are situated due north of our house, one way of finding out their exact locations is to find the direct distance to the well from the house and the direct distance to the coconut tree from the house.

For example, if the distances from the house to the well and to the coconut tree are 105 m and 173 m respectively, then the location of the well is 105 m to the north of the house, and the location of the coconut tree is 173 m to the north of the house. We can find the exact location of the well and the coconut tree in this way.

The location of a place with respect to a particular point can be described exactly by specifying the direction in which it is located with respect to the point and the distance from the point to it. Do the review exercise to revise what you have learnt in lower grades.

Any number that is on the right hand side of a given number on the number lineis greater than the given number. This property is applicable to the whole numberline. Therefore this rule can be applied when comparing two integers using thenumber line.

Since 2 is on the right hand side of (- 3) on the number line, 2 is greater than (- 3). Thiscan be written either as 2 > (- 3) or as (- 3) < 2'

When dividing a unit on the number line into several equal parts to represent a particular number, it is necessary to be careful to select the number of equal parts appropriately, depending on the number that is to be represented. It is suitable to divide one unit into 10 equal parts when representing a decimal number with one decimal place, and to divide one unit into parts equaling the number in the denominator when representing a fraction.

25'3 Representing inequalities containing an algebraic term on a number line

According to the rules of a certain competition, only children of height greater than 120 cm are allowed to participate. If the height of a competitor is denoted by h cm, this means that h > 120' Accordingly, anyone of height greater than 120 cm such as 121 cm, 125 cm or 127 cm can participate in the competition.

x > 2 is an inequality. This means that the values that x can take are only those which are greater than 2. On the other hand the inequality x ≥ 2 means that the values that x can take are those which are greater than or equal to 2.

$ The symbol > is used to denote ‘greater than’,

$ the symbol < is used to denote ‘less than’,

$ the symbol ≥ is used to denote ‘greater than or equal’, and

$ the symbol ≤ is used to denote ‘less than or equal’.

Accordingly, 8 > x can also be written as x < 8" and 2 ≥ y can also be written as y ≤ 2'

Therefore, h > 120 means that the values that h can take are only those values which are greater than 120.

The set of all values that the algebraic term in an inequality with one algebraic term can take is called the set of solutions of the inequality.

Summary

To construct a triangle when the lengths of the three sides are given, the following steps are performed.

$ Constructing a straight line segment of length equal to the length of one of the sides of the triangle. $ Constructing an arc of length equal to the length of another side of the triangle by placing the point of the pair of compasses at one end point of the above straight line segment. $ Constructing another arc from the other end point of the straight line segment, of length equal to the length of the remaining side, so that it intersects the above drawn arc. $ Joining the point of intersection of the two arcs to the end points of the straight line segment. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the remaining side.

27 Data Representation and Interpretation

By studying this lesson you will be able to, ²represent data in a stem and leaf diagram, ²find the maximum value, minimum value and the range of a collection of data using a stem and leaf diagram, and ²find the mode, median, mean and range of a collection of raw data.

27'1 Stem and leaf diagram

In Grades 6 and 7, you learnt to represent and interpret data using picture graphs, bar graphs and multi bar graphs. Now we will consider what a stem and leaf diagram is and how data is represented in a stem and leaf diagram.

A stem and leaf diagram is a standard method of organizing numerical data to enable us to interpret the data easily.

When data is organized according to this method,

• if the values of the data are from 0 to 99, the value in the units place of a datum is indicated as the leaf and the value in the tens place is indicated as the stem. • if the values of the data are from 100 to 999, the value in the units place is indicated as the leaf and the values in the tens and hundreds places considered together is indicated as the stem.

² Only the digit in the units place is indicated as the leaf.

² For values from 0 to 9, the stem takes the value 0.

² If a row has more than one leaf value, the values are written leaving a gap between the digits.

Example 1

(i) Write the stem and leaf of each of the numbers 2, 43 and 225.(ii) Write the datum of which the stem is 3 and the leaf is 0.

Let us represent this data in a stem and leaf diagram.

In a stem and leaf diagram, the first column is called the stem and the second column is called the leaf.

¾ All the numbers are written in ascending order such that the stems of the numbers are in the first column (stem column) and the leaves of the numbers are in the second column, and with the numbers from 0 to 9 in the first row, the numbers from 10 to 19 in the second row and the numbers from 20 to 29 in the third row etc.

¾ The numbers in the fourth row of the above stem and leaf diagram have 3 as the stem and 1, 3, 5, 6, 8 respectively as the leaves. Their corresponding values are 31, 33, 35, 36, and 38.

The numbers represented in the other rows can also be written as shown above.

¾ It is easier to understand information related to the above 25 data when they are represented in a stem and leaf diagram than when they are written in a row.

²If the students who obtained less than 20 marks failed the test, then we can easily say that the number of students who failed is 3 + 4 = 7.

²If an “A” pass is given to those who have obtained 40 or more marks, then we can easily say by considering the stem and leaf diagram that there are 5 such students.

Now let us consider how a given collection of data is interpreted.

² During a pluck, we can usually get 8 coconuts from each coconut tree in an estate.

² The average mark of a student for 8 subjects is 73.6.

² The average runs scored per over in a certain cricket match was 5.3.

² On a certain day, the price of 1 kg of beans displayed by most of the vendors in a market was 120 rupees.

A single value that is used to give an idea regarding a collection of data, as in the above examples is called a representative value.

We will now consider a few representative values that are used.

²Mode

The marks obtained by the 13 students in a certain class for a mathematics question paper are given below.

96" 81" 78" 45" 71" 57" 71" 83" 95" 68" 94" 71" 79

The ‘number of data in a collection’ is the total number of data in that collection.

The number of data in the above collection is 13.

Let us write these values in ascending order.

45" 57" 68" 71" 71" 71" 78" 79" 81" 83" 94" 95" 96

The mark that has been obtained the most is 71. Three students have obtained this mark.

In a collection of data, some of the values could be identical. The value which occurs most often is called the mode of that collection of data.

In the above collection of data, since 71 is the value that occurs most often, 71 is the mode.

Note:It is not necessary to write the data in ascending order to find the mode.

Example 1

The ages of 10 students in Grade 8 are given below in years. Find the mode of this collection of data. 13 14 15 14 15 14 14 14 13 14

In the above collection of data, 14 years is the value that occurs most frequently. Therefore the mode of the ages of these grade 8 students is 14.

Example 2

The number of employees who took leave on each of the 15 working days of a certain month is given below. Find the mode of this collection of data. 12 14 20 16 15 16 21 19 16 18 17 15 18 19 18

Here, the values 16 and 18 have each occurred 3 times. The other values have occurred less than 3 times. Therefore, we can take 16 or 18 as the mode of this collection of data.

Such a distribution of data is known as a bimodal distribution. A collection of data may have more than two modes too.

²Median

¾ Let us consider a collection of data with an odd number of values.

The median of a collection of data is the value of the datum in the centre, when the data is arranged in ascending order.

There are 11 data. The 6th datum is in the centre. Its value is 22. There are 5 data values less than 22 and 5 data values greater than 22.

If the number of values in a collection of data is an odd number, then the value in the centre, when the values are arranged in ascending order, is the median of the collection of data.

Accordingly, the median of the above collection of data is 22.

When the values of the above collection of data are arranged in ascending order, the value in the centre is the 11 + 12 = 6th value. Therefore, the median of this set of data is 22.

¾ Now let us consider a collection of data with an even number of values.

3" 9" 9" 11" 15 22" 24" 25" 31" 37" 40" 41

There are 12 values in this collection of data, which is an even number. Here, we cannot find a datum in the centre. The two data in the centre are the 6th and 7th data. Their values are 22 and 24 respectively.

• If there is an even number of data, the median is half the sum of the values of the two data in the centre, when the data are arranged in ascending order.

• If there is an even number of data, and if the values of the data are arranged in ascending order, then the data in the centre are the (number of data2)th datum and the (number of data2+1) th datum.

• There fore the median of the above data is 22 + 242 ; that is, 23. There are 6 data less than 23 and 6 data greater than 23.

Example 3 The number of soft drink bottles sold at a certain shop on each day of a week is given below. Find the median of the number of bottles sold during a day. 32 60 52 44 48 41 40When this data is organized in ascending order we obtain 32 40 41 44 48 52 60

When this data is organized in ascending order we obtain,

09 12 14 15 15 16 18 18 20 20 21 22 23 25 26 36 There are two values in the centre. There are two values in the centre because there are 16 scores in total. They are the value of the 16 2 = 8th datum and the value of the 16 2 + 1 = 9th datum. The value of the 8th datum = 18The value of the 9th datum = 20 ∴ the median = 18 + 202 = 19

The median number of athletes who came for training to the sports centre each day is 19.

Example 5 (i) A group of 15 students who are members of a drill display, are made to stand in a row as shown in the figure in ascending order of their heights, after their heights were measured in centimetres. Find the median of this collection of data.

In the figure, the student in the centre is caged. This is the 8th student. We can easily obtain the value in the centre when there is an odd number of data. The median of this distribution is the value of the 15 + 12 = 8th datum. The height of the 8th student is 127 cm. Therefore, the median of this collection of data is 127 cm.

Accordingly, the median is the value that is obtained when the heights of the 8th and 9th students are added together and divided by 2. Therefore the median is

127 + 135 cm; 2 that is, 131 cm.

The mean of the = 45 + 57 + 69 + 71 + 71 + 71 + 78 + 79 + 81 + 81 + 94 + 95 + 9613 data = 76By comparing the value 76 with the total marks of 100 allocated for this mathematics test paper, we can assess these students’ knowledge and skills in mathematics.

The average value of a collection of data is considered as its mean. The mean of a collection of data is the value that is obtained when the sum of all the values of the collection of data is divided by the number of values.

The marks of the students vary across the classes, but the medians and the means are the same for all three classes.

In such situations, interpreting the data using only the median and the mean is insufficient. We need to consider the dispersion (spread) of the data too. For this we use measurements related to the dispersion of the data.

In this lesson we learn about one measurement of dispersion, namely the range.

The marks obtained by 8 students in a certain class for a mathematics test paper marked out of 100 are given below.

12" 28" 56" 48" 32" 64" 80" 92

Let us write the above values in ascending order.

12" 28" 32" 48" 56" 64" 80" 92

The maximum value of the above data set is 92 and the minimum value is 12.The difference between the maximum value and the minimum value is 92 - 12 = 80. It indicates that the dispersion of the data is 80 units.

The difference between the greatest value and the least value of a collection of data is called its range.

Range = Greatest value – Least valueThe range of the above set of data is 80.

• The difference between the maximum mark of 100 and the minimum mark of 0 that can be scored by as student for the above mathematics test paper is 100.

• When the value of the range is comparatively low, the data take values which are close to each other. The range 80 in the above example is relatively large, when compared with 100. Therefore we can conclude that the marks are not close to each other.

Example 7 The marks obtained by another class of 8 students for a mathematics test paper are written below in ascending order. Find the range of these marks.

46" 48" 49" 50" 50" 51" 52" 54

The range of the above marks = 54 − 46 = 8

The range 8 in this example is relatively small when compared with 100.Therefore we can say that the marks are approximately at the same level, and conclude that these students' knowledge tested in this paper is at about the same level.

The most suitable representative value:

The runs scored by a cricketer during 8 overs of a cricket match are given below. 3" 8" 9" 12" 5" 3" 5" 3

The total number of runs he scored is 48. When the runs he scored in each of the 8 overs are written in ascending order we obtain 3" 3" 3" 5" 5" 8" 9" 12

The mode of this collection of data is 3.

Summary

Data can be represented easily using a stem and leaf diagram. Understanding the data is facilitated by using a stem and leaf diagram.

In a collection of data, some of the values could be identical. The value which occurs most often is called the mode of that collection of data.

If the number of values in a collection of data is an odd number, then the value at the centre, when the values are arranged in ascending order, is the median of the collection of data.

If there is an even number of data, the median is half the sum of the values of the two data at the centre, when arranged in ascending order.

The mean of a collection of data is the value that is obtained when the sum of all the values of the collection of data is divided by the number of values.

The difference between the greatest value and the least value of a collection of data is called its range.

Range = Greatest value – Least value

28 Scale Diagrams

By studying this lesson you will be able to, ²identify what a scale diagram is, ²calculate the actual lengths of a rectilinear plane figure which has been drawn according to a given scale, and ²draw a scale diagram according to a given scale, when the actual measurements of a rectilinear plane figure are given.

28'1 Scale diagrams

It is often difficult to draw the various objects in the environment according to the actual measurements.

In such situations, for every rectilinear plane figure, (i) a figure drawn to represent the shape of the original figure is called a sketch, and (ii) when a rectilinear plane figure is drawn such that every measurement of length is increased or decreased by the same ratio, the drawn figure is called a scale diagram of the given figure.

The shape of a figure in a scale diagram is exactly the same as the shape of the original figure, and only the size is different.

A sketch of the room

A scale diagram of the floor of the room can be drawn in your exercise book by representing an actual measurement of 1 m by 1 cm. Since 1 m is 100 cm, 1 cm in the scale diagram represents 100 cm of the floor. This is represented as a ratio by 1: 100. This ratio is known as the scale of the scale diagram.

28'2 Calculating the lengths corresponding to actual lengths when the scale of a scale diagram is given

Suppose we want to draw a scale diagram of the rectangular floor of a hall of length 6 m and breadth 4 m, using the scale 1 : 200. Let us find the length of each side in the scale diagram.

In the scale diagram, an actual length of 200 cm = 1 cm an actual length of 600 cm = 1200 × 600 cm = 3 cm

an actual length of 400 cm = 1200 × 400 cm = 2 cm

Since, 400 cm = 4 m and 6 m = 600 cm, the length of the floor in the scale diagram is 3 cm and the breadth is 2 cm.

i.e., the lengths 6 m and 4 m are represented by 3 cm and 2 cm respectively in the scale diagram.

A sketch of a triangular plot of land is shown in the figure. If a scale diagram of this plot is to be drawn to the scale 1 : 2500, find the length of each boundary of this plot in the scale diagram. The scale is 1 : 2500.

Since 2500 cm = 25 m, an actual length of 25 m is represented by 1 cm in the scale diagram.∴ In the scale diagram,

a length of 200 m is represented by 20025 cm, that is by 8 cm, a length of 150 m is represented by 15025 cm, that is by 6 cm,

a length of 125 m is represented by 12525 cm, that is by 5 cm.

By what length is an actual length of 250 m represented in a scale diagram which has been drawn to the scale 1 : 10 000? 1 cm represents 10 000 cm. 1 cm in the scale diagram represents an actual length of 100 m.That is, an actual length of 100 m is represented by 1 cm in the scale diagram.∴ In the scale diagram, an actual length of 250 m is represented by 250100 = 2'5 cm'

29 Probability

By studying this lesson you will be able to, ² identify what the fraction of success of an outcome of a random experiment is, ² identify what the experimental probability of an event is, and ² identify what the theoretical probability of an event is.

29'1 Likelihood of an event occurring

Let us consider some events that occur in the environment. “The rising of the sun from the east” is an event that definitely occurs.

“The appearance of a full moon on a new moon day” is an event that definitely does not occur.

Let us consider the event of “a coin landing heads up when it is flipped”. We cannot say definitely which of the two events “landing heads up” and “landing tails up” will occur. Therefore this is a random event.

You learnt in grade 7 that events can be classified into three groups. They are;

²Events which definitely occur

²Events which definitely do not occur

²Random eventsConsider flipping a coin.

¾ The experiment is flipping the coin and observing the side that lands up.

¾ The outcomes of this experiment are; “the coin landing heads up” and “the coin landing tails up”.

¾ If the coin is a fair (unbiased) coin, then there is an equal likelihood of each of these two outcomes occurring.

² The likelihood of an event which definitely does not occur is 0.

² The likelihood of an event which definitely occurs is 1.

² The likelihood of a random event occurring takes a value between 0 and 1, based on its tendency to occur.

For Free Distribution150

Accordingly, the likelihood of the sun rising from the west is 0, the likelihood of the sun rising from the east is 1 and

the likelihood of a coin landing heads up when it is flipped takes a value between 0 and 1.

When a fair coin is flipped, there is an equal likelihood of it landing heads up and not landing heads up. Therefore we consider the likelihood of it landing heads up as 12 and not landing heads up (landing tails up) as 12 '

² If there is an equal chance of an event occurring and of not occurring, then the likelihood of each is 12 '

² If the chance of an event occurring is greater than the chance of it not occurring, then the likelihood of that event occurring is a value between 12 and 1'

² If the chance of an event not occurring is greater than the chance of it occurring, then the likelihood of that event occurring is a value between 0 and 12'

² If p is the likelihood of a random event occurring, then the likelihood of it not occurring is 1 - p.

When rolling an unbiased die with its faces marked with the numbers 1 to 6 (one number on each face), since there is an equal chance of each of the numbers from 1 to 6 showing up, the likelihood of 1 showing up is taken as 16 . Accordingly, the likelihood of 1 not showing up is 1 - 16 = 56 '

29'2 Experimental Probability

² Random experiment

Let us consider again the event of a coin landing tails up when flipped. When the coin is being flipped, we cannot say with certainty whether it would land heads up or tails up. You have learnt that such an event is called a random event.

The experiment is flipping a coin and observing the side that lands up.

The outcomes of this experiment are “the coin landing heads up” and “the coin landing tails up”.

An experiment of which the possible outcomes are known, but the actual outcome cannot be stated with certainty before the experiment is conducted is called a random experiment.

A random experiment has the following common features.

² Can be repeated any number of times under the same conditions

² The actual outcome cannot be stated with certainty before the experiment is conducted

² All the possible outcomes of the experiment are known before the experiment is conducted

²Fraction of Success (Relative frequency)

A Rs. 2 coin was flipped 20 times and the side that landed up wasobserved. The following are the outcomes.

The coin landed heads up 11 times. The coin landed tails up 9 times.

The fraction of success of the coin landing heads up is

the number of times the coin landed heads upthe number of time the coin was flipped

∴ The fraction of success of the coin landing heads up = 1120

The fraction of success of the coin landing tails up is

the number of times the coin landed tails upthe number of time the coin was flipped

∴ The fraction of success of the coin landing tails up = 920

Activity 1

Complete the table by flipping a coin 40 times with your friends.

Number of times the coin was flipped

Number of times tails occurred

Number of times heads occurred

Number of times tails occurred

Number of times the coin was flipped

Number of times heads occurred

Number of times the coin was flipped

An important conclusion that we can arrive at through this experiment is that the fractions,

number of times tails occurrednumber of times the coin was flipped and number of times heads occurred

number of times the coin was flipped

approach the value 12 as the number of times the coin is flipped is increased.

What this means is that when a fair coin is flipped, the likelihood of the coin landing heads up, that is the experimental probability of the coin landing heads up is 12'

In this case, the experimental probability of the coin landing tails up is also 12 '

² Since the number of times an outcome of an experiment occurs is always less than or equal to the total number of times the experiment is repeated, the fraction of success of an outcome takes a value from 0 to 1. If the fraction of success of the outcome A approaches a constant value when the number of times the experiment is repeated (n) is increased, then that value is called the experimental probability of the outcome A occurring when the experiment is conducted once.

The sun always rises from the east, and does not depend on the number of times the sunrise is observed.Therefore, the probability of the sun rising from the east is 1. The probability of the sun rising from the south is 0 because it never rises from the south.

² If an outcome will definitely occur, then irrespective of the value n (the number of times the experiment is conducted) takes, its fraction of success is nn = 1'

In this case, the probability of the outcome occurring is 1. Accordingly, the

probability of an event that will definitely occur is 1.

² If an outcome cannot occur when an experiment is conducted, then, irrespective

of the value n takes, its fraction of success is 0n = 0' Therefore, the probability of that outcome occurring is 0. Accordingly, the probability of an event that will definitely not occur is 0.

Apart from these two special cases, the probability of a possible outcome of a

random experiment occurring is a value between 0 and 1.

When the probability of an outcome of a random experiment occurring is not known, then, the fraction of success that is obtained by increasing n, that is by conducting the experiment a large number of times, is value that is suitable to be used as an estimate of the probability of that outcome occurring.³

29'3 Theoretical Probability

Let us find the probability of the occurrence of each possible outcome of a random experiment with equally likely outcomes.

¾ In the random experiment of flipping an unbiased coin and observing the side that lands up, the outcomes are “the coin landing heads up” and “the coin landing tails up”. The likelihood of each of these two outcomes occurring is the same.

¾ When an unbiased die is rolled, the number on the face that shows up is either 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6. There is an equal likelihood of each of these outcomes occurring.

The probability of 2 showing up when an unbiased die is rolled can be calculated as follows.

The outcome can be either 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6. Since the die is unbiased, there is an equal likelihood of each of these six numbers showing up. Therefore, the probability of any one of the six numbers from 1 to 6 showing up is 16 '

Accordingly, the probability of 2 showing up = 16

² Three of the six numbers on the die are even numbers. Therefore, the probability of an even number showing up is 36 = 12 '

When there is an equal likelihood of each of the possible outcomes of a random experiment occurring, the theoretical probability of a selected outcome occurring

= 1total number of possible outcomes of the random experiment .

The method of finding the theoretical probability of each outcome of a random experiment, when the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the experiment occurring are different to each other, is described in the following example.

Example 1

In an opaque bag, there are 4 red balls, 5 blue balls and 2 green balls which are identical in all aspects except the colour. Find the probability of a ball drawn from the bag (i) being red. (ii) being blue.(iii) being green. Probability of being red = number of red ballstotal number of balls

= 411

Probability of being blue = number of blue ballstotal number of balls

= 511

30 Tessellation

By studying this lesson, you will be able to, ²identify what regular tessellations and semi-regular tessellations are, ²select suitable polygons to create regular and semi-regular tessellations, and ²create regular and semi-regular tessellations.

30'1 Tessellation

Let us recall what was learnt in Grade 7 about tessellation.

Covering a certain space using one or more shapes, in a repeated pattern, without gaps and without overlaps is called tessellation. An arrangement of shapes of this form is also called a tessellation.

If a tessellation consists of one shape only, it is called a pure tessellation.

If a tessellation consists of two or more shapes, it is called a semi-pure tessellation.

In tessellations where rectilinear plane figures are used, the sum of the angles around each vertex point is 360o.

Therefore, the shapes that are selected for such tessellations should be such that the 360o around a point on a plane can be covered without gaps and without overlaps with the selected shapes.

Do the following review exercise to revise the facts you have learnt previously on tessellation.

30'2 Regular tessellation

We know that a polygon with sides of equal length and interior angles of equal magnitude is a regular polygon. Equilateral triangles, squares, regular pentagons and regular hexagons are examples of regular polygons.

A tessellation created using only one regular polygonal shape is known as a regular tessellation.

When creating a regular tessellation,

²a vertex of one geometrical shape should not be on a side of another geometrical shape.

Figure 1

In the tessellation in Figure 1 created with equilateral triangles, all the shapes are identical regular polygons. A vertex of any triangle is not located on a side of another triangle. Therefore this is a regular tessellation.

Figure 2

In the creation in Figure 2, although identical regular polygons have been used, the vertices of some polygons lie on the sides of other polygons. Therefore, this is not a regular tessellation.

Activity 1

Step 1 - Trace these regular polygonal shapes onto coloured paper using a tissue paper and cut out 10 shapes of each kind.

Step 2 - Create a regular tessellation using only the triangular shapes and paste it in your exercise book.

Step 3 - Examine each of the other shapes carefully and check whether a regular tessellation can be created.

Step 4 - Using the shapes that were identified above as those with which regular tessellations can be created, create regular tessellations and paste them in your exercise book.

Step 5 - Find out how many types of regular polygons can be used to create regular tessellations.

Step 6 - Investigate the condition that needs to be satisfied by an interior angle of a regular polygon, to be able to create a regular tessellation with that polygon.

According to the above activity, we can create regular tessellations by using either equilateral triangles or squares or regular hexagons only.

In the creation of regular tessellations, the vertices of the regular shapes used should meet at particular points. These are called the vertices of the tessellations.

The sum of the angles around each vertex point of a tessellation is 360o.

It must be clear to you through the above activity that a regular tessellation can be created by using a particular regular polygon, only if 360o is a multiple of the magnitude of an interior angle of that polygon.

An interior angle of a regular pentagon is 108o. Since 3600 is not divisible by 108o, we cannot create a regular tessellation by using a regular pentagon.

30'3 Semi-regular tessellation

Tessellations created using two or more regular polygons, and such that the same polygons in the same order (when considered clockwise or anticlockwise) surround each vertex point are called semi-regular tessellations.

AB

Given here is a semi-regular tessellation created using squares and equilateral triangles.

Observe how the polygons are positioned at the vertex points A and B. You can see that three triangular shapes and two square shapes meet at each of these two points. At both points, the three triangles and the two squares are positioned in the same order, with the three triangles together followed by the two squares next to each other. This feature can be observed in the whole tessellation.

This is a feature of a semi-regular tessellation. That is, in a semi-regular tessellation, the same polygonal shapes should surround each vertex point and they should be positioned in the same order around these points.

A

B

This tessellation is made up of equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. Observe the vertex points A and B carefully. We can clearly see that the orders in which the polygons are positioned around these two points are different to each other.

Since the orders in which the shapes are positioned at different vertex points are not identical, this tessellation is not a semi-regular tessellation.

Step 1 - Cut out the shapes used in Activity 1 again using coloured paper.

Step 2 - Create semi-regular tessellations using two types of shapes and paste them in your exercise book.Step 3 - Create semi-regular tessellations using three types of shapes and paste them in your exercise book.
