Foreword

With the continuous advancement of the world, the education sector too is transformed. Therefore, if we require the creation of a student community who could confront the future challenges successfully, our learning teaching process must constantly utilize effective approaches. It is our responsibility to disseminate the knowledge of the new world while assisting to create global citizens with good values. Our department is actively engaged in producing learning tools with the great aim of contributing to enlighten the minds of the children of the country.

A textbook is a repository of knowledge. At times, it takes us to a world of entertainment while developing our critical thinking faculties. It promotes our hidden potentials. In the coming years, the memories related to these textbooks will bring you happiness. While making the maximum use of this valuable learning tool, you must essentially access other useful knowledge spaces too. I wish that you would gain the ability to enlighten the future as citizens with knowledge and values by using this textbook.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the panels of writers, editors and reviewers as well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department for the contribution made on this endeavor.

Brother, Do you know the book that is translated into the most number of languages in the world?

O, Yes I know, it is the Bible.

Oh! don’t say like that. The Bible is a Sacred Book. It is the most Sacred Book for us Catholics. We should speak of it as the Holy Bible. The Word of God is found there. Therefore we must use it with great respect. We must take it and give it with both hands.

Then sister, don’t we keep it on the book shelf?

Yes brother, we shouldn’t put any other book on the Holy Bible. We should keep it in a clean special place with a vase of flowers and a lighted lamp. Let us also use it like that.

How is it sister, that the Holy Bible is such a big book?

All information regarding the history of Salvation is found in the Holy Bible. It is a library in itself, brother. There are 73 books in the Holy Bible. It is divided into two parts. The Old Testament and the New Testament.

Why is it, that the Holy Bible is in two parts sister?

The period before the birth of Jesus Christ is explained in the Old Testament. In the New Testament we find about the life of Jesus Christ and first Christian Church. In the Old Testament it is also recorded about the historical incidents about God and how God’s revelation was revealed through the patriarchs and prophets. There are 46 books in the Old Testament. In the New Testament we see how God’s revelation was brought into fullness through Jesus Christ. It also shows us that salvation of the whole human race brought to us through Jesus Christ. There are 27 books in the New Testament.

Then the Holy Bible is a very valuable book, isn’t it sister?

Yes, It is not only one book a library of books. The Holy Bible is the foundation of our faith, hope and also our Christian life. It took more than 1000 years for many Bible writers to compose it. Therefore there should be a Holy Bible in every home.

The book of ExodusThis is the second book of the Holy Bible. In this book the central theme of the history of Israel is explained as the escape of God’s people from the slavery of Egypt to the Promised Land under the leadership of Moses. This book also explains how the Israelites experienced God’s love and protection in the wilderness. Through the Covenant of Sinai, God gave them the “Ten Commandments” and accepted them as his own people.

3 The Four Gospels

Out of 27 books of the New Testament the first four books are called the “Gospels”. They are named after the author who wrote them. Each author, using his own point of view, wrote about Jesus’ birth, His mission and teachings, and about His death and resurrection. These four Gospels; written by four Evangelists about the life of Jesus, are the focal point of all the Scriptures.

1. Gospel of Matthew written by St. Mathew.2. Gospel of Mark written by St. Mark.3. Gospel of Luke written by St. Luke.4. Gospel of John written by St. John.

1. Gospel of Matthew

Picture 3.1 - St. Mathew

St. Matthew was one of the 12 apostles of Jesus. He was a tax collector before he was called by Jesus. After he was called by Jesus, he became one of the faithful disciples of Jesus and experienced Him in many ways. He wrote his Gospel to prove that Jesus was the Messiah who

Picture 3.2 - Symbol man

2. Gospel of Mark

Mark was not an apostle of Jesus. He was a disciple of St. Peter. He was also known as John Mark. He had been a translator for Peter. Therefore we can think that he received information about Jesus from St. Peter. He begins his Gospel with the preaching of John de Baptist. The symbol of this Gospel is a lion. Because he preached in a powerful voice M.K. 1:3

Picture 3.3 - St. MarkPicture 3.4- Symbol Lion

was expected by the Jews. He also showed how most of the Prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus. He begins his Gospel with the Genealogy of Jesus. The symbol of his Gospel is a figure of a man.

3. Gospel of St. Luke

Picture 3.5 - St. LukePicture 3.6 - Symbol bull

10

St. Luke was not an apostle of Jesus. He was a Physician, a historian and a painter. The only ‘Gentile’ who wrote a gospel was St. Luke. He had been with St. Paul in his missionary journeys. He has written his gospel after gathering information from various sources. We come across some hymns of praise, prayers and also information regarding some pious ladies.In His Gospel he proves that Jesus Christ is the Saviour of the whole human race and not only of the Jews. He begins his gospel with the sacrifice of Zechariah. Bull was a sacrificial offering at that time. Therefore his symbol is a bull (ox)

4. Gospel of St. John

St. John was an apostle of Jesus. His brother great St. James was also an apostle of Jesus. Before the call of Jesus they were fishermen. Sebadee and Salome were their parents. Mother Mary was a cousin of Salome. So both those apostles were cousins of Jesus. His teachings are very deep and unfathomable beyond human understanding. Therefore the symbol for this Gospel is an eagle. John himself said that the purpose of his Gospel was: “These things are written that you may believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and by believing Christ's coming, you may have eternal life". Christ’s coming into this world is Good News. Because by Jesus' coming into this world the whole human race was saved.

Picture 4.1 - God's Creation

Day and Night

The earth was a formless, void and darkness covered face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters. Then God said, “Let there be light”. And there was light. And God saw that the light was good and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day. Genesis 1:2-5

God is the creator of this world. God created this wonderful world in all it’s richness, diversity and order, because of His infinite love for us. Therefore we should love the whole of God's creation. In the book of Genesis it is recorded how God created this world, by the power of his Word. Let us read some of those passages in the Holy Bible.

4 Creation of the World

Earth and TreesSun, Moon and the Star

Water and Sky

And God said, “Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the dome. So God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome. And it was so. God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day. Genesis 1:6-8

And God said “ Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear” And it was so. God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let the earth put forth vegetation; plants yielding seeds, and fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it.” And it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seeds of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruits with the seed in it. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning, the third day. Genesis 1:9-13

God made the to great lights, the Greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and the stars. God set them in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness and God saw that it was good. and there was evening and there was morning and the fourth day

Genesis 1:16-19

Birds and fishThe living creatures

and man

From the above passages in the book of Genesis in the Holy Bible we can understand that God created the world in six days. Psalm 104 of the Holy Bible clearly tells us that all the creations in the world are the work of God. When God created the world he was very much concerned about the needs of human beings and man can find in God’s creation whatever is necessary for him for his day to day life. God gave him also a beautiful environment. Man is the summit of the Creators work. Let us be determined always

So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and every winged bird of every kind. And God saw it was good. God blessed them saying “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let birds multiply on earth. And there was evening and there was morning the fifth day. Genesis 1:21-23

And God said” Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind.” And it was so. God made the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the cattle of every kind, and every thing that creeps upon the ground of every kind. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air and over the cattle and over all the wild animals of the earth and over every creeping things that creeps upon the earth.” So God created humankind in his image in the image of God he created them,male and female he created them, …that was the sixth day. Genesis 1:24-27

2. God said’ See I have given you every plant yielding seeds and every tree with seed in its fruit you shall have them for food.

3. The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it.

4. Out of all the things that God created man is the summit of the creators work filled with goodness and love; let us protect our human dignity.

5. Birds of the air flying in the sky and butterflies of beautiful hues flutter their wings and colourful fish swim in the water. All these add beauty to God’s wonderful creation. Yes, we thank thee Lord for everything and we care and preserve your glorious creation.

Now let us see what God said to our first parents, Adam and Eve.

6. Water generates electricity, water in the sea gives us salt, that gives flavor to our foods. Medicinal plants supply us with medicine for our sicknesses and the good God has blessed us abundantly through his creation.

7. Rivers, lakes, streams and waterfalls give us water to make furtile the farms and gardens. Let us keep the water clean and pure for drinking, bathing and washing.

8. Let us collect the waste matter that decays, separate it from non- decaying matter and make manuré for our home gardens.

9. Let us grow flowers, vegetables and fruit trees and make our home school and church gardens colourful and pleasant to live in.

10. Father, Mother, Brother and Sister, let all of us unite, care for and protect the environment to make this world more beautiful.

The above scripture passage show us some of the responsibilities that God gave man because God loves him so much.

1. To beget children2. To spread all over the earth.3. Have dominion over the fish of the sea and birds of the air to look after them for their human needs.4. To till the earth5. To use the fruits of the earth for their food

God made man the master of the earth to care to protect and to develop the earth, so that he can make use of it. That is our responsibility. But today man has been unable to protect God’s creation.

Eg: Pollution of environment, destruction of forests use of polythene, pollution of air and water, not having a proper and regular way of putting away the garbage and waste matter.It is very necessary to protect and develop the natural resources which God, has placed in the earth. These are the free gifts that we have received from God. Let us give thanks to God, the creator of so many various things for the use of man.

God blessed them and said to them ‘ Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth. God said see, I have given you every plant yielding seeds that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seeds in its fruit, you shall have them for food”The Lord took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it. Genesis 1:28-29 & 2:15

6 God’s Greatest Creation

I was born in a laboratory many years ago. I did not come out of a mother’s womb to see the light of this world. I have neither parents nor brothers nor sisters. I was made by some clever group of engineers. People use me for their various needs, holding responsibilities in Medical Science and Bio Science, deflating bombs, going to the moon and going to the places where man cannot reach and to gather information. These are some of the duties that I have to perform. But of these works are done according to

my own decision. I am able to act according to the data installed in me by human beings. Though I perform a lot of wonderful acts. I cannot be compared to a human being. I have no mind, no intelligence; neither do I have a heart. Yet, man is not like me. Man is one of God’s noblest creations. He is a sublime being. I am nothing compared with man. Man is a living being. He received that life by the divine breath of God. I am an instrument activated by others. I who spoke to you so far is a Robot.

Picture 6.1 - Robo

22

God created man in His own image and likeness. Only man can have partnership in God's divine life. God gave man authority over the whole of created things. Man can discover the earth explore it, make use of it; care for it and develop it. Only man has partnership with God in creating. From all these we can see that man is above and greater than all other created things.

2. Then God formed man and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.

Man who was formed from the dust of the earth, became a living being, because God breathed His breath of life into man. God did not do this when He created animals. Hence, man is highest of God's creations.

“Then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life” Genesis 2:7

Why man’s dignity is greater than any of the other creations

1. Likeness to God’s image

Then God said, “ Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness. and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth. So God created humankind in His image. Genesis 1:26

23

3. God proclaiming that the day man was created was “ very good”

God who said, "it was good", after creating all the other creations, said " it was very good " after creating man. God's creation became complete after He had created man. This shows that man has dominion over all other creations, and all these were created for the benefit of man.

“God saw everything that he had made and indeed it was very good” Genesis 1:31

4. Man gave a name to all the beasts.

It was the man who gave a name to all the beasts and birds of every kind. Through this, it shows that man has power over all the animals, birds and all that God created.

Diversity of man and respecting each other

Man is the summit of the Creator’s work. We are all not the same. Each one is unique. Each one's talents, likes and dislikes, capabilities, colour of the skin, shape and everything is different. In our country, we have four or more nationalities; Sinhala, Tamil, Muslims and Burghers. They belong to four different religions, Buddhist, Hindus, Islam, Catholic, Christians and others. Our level of intelligence is different. We are different as males and females.

‘The man gave name to all the cattle and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field’. Genesis 2:20

24

According to God’s plan the whole human race displays various types of talents and capabilities. Because of this quality the value of God’s creation is increased. We need each others’ assistance. We all have God’s image and likeness within us. Hence we should respect each other. Whether we are male or female in that difference we have to respect each other. Whether we belong to different nationalties or different religions or whether we speak different languages we must respect each other and live in peace and harmony with each other.

Besides, our capabilities are different and varied. The differences between those capabilities are shown in the pictures below.

“Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God and now you will conceive in your womb and bear a Son, and you will name him Jesus”

How can this be, since I am a virgin?

“The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most high will overshadow you; Therefore the child to be born will be holy; He will be called Son of God. And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a Son and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren. For nothing is impossible for God.”

“Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.” So I bowed my head to the will of God.

So, was Joseph willing to accept you?

No, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said to him that I have conceived a child by the power of the Holy Spirit. I will bear a Son and you are to name him ‘Jesus’, for he will save his people from their sins. All this has taken place to fulfill what has been said by the prophet Isaiah’ He also bowed his head to the will of God.

Then, where was Jesus born?

That’s a long story. In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the people in his kingdom should be registered.

Listen! Listen! Emperor Augustus has issued a decree to all his people, all of you people go to your, birth place and get yourself registered for the Census.

28

Because Joseph and I were descendants of David, we went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea to the city of David, called Bethlehem When we were there it was time for me to deliver the baby. It was getting dark. Joseph went about looking for a place for the two of us to stay the night

"Is it possible for the two of us to stay the night here?"

I do not think that there is room in any of the inns in this city. Your wife seems to be in a very serious condition. If you like, you can spend the night in our stable.

Thank you very much.'

So did you give birth to your baby in a stable?

Yes, I bowed my head to the will of God and gave birth to my first born Son and wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a manger. In that region there were shepherds living in the fields keeping watch over their flocks by night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them.“Do not be afraid; for see, I am bringing you good news of great joy for all people. To you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour who is the Messiah, the Lord. There will be a sign for you, you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth lying in a manger.

Jesus is named

After eight days had passed, it was time to circumcise the child; and he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. Luke 2:21Jesus is presented in the Temple

When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, ”Every first born male shall be designated as holy to the Lord”) and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the Lord, “a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons.” Luke 2:22-24

The above Bible passages present some of the Jews’ religious and national customs.

 Circumcision on the eight day. Naming of the child. Purification rite Offering the first born child to the Lord.

Mary and Joseph fulfilled all the religious and National customs of the Jewish people.In society today many people do not respect the religious and national customs. The Holy Family gives us an example of being faithful to those customs. The Infant Jesus was circumcised after eight days of his birth. The name ‘Jesus’ given by the angel was given to the baby. According to the law of Moses when the time came for the purification, the infant Jesus was taken to the temple of Jerusalem by Mary and Joseph.

From this we can understand that we too must obey and respect the religious and national customs of our country.

8 The Childhood of Jesus Christ

Every year the parents of Jesus, went to Jerusalem for the festival Passover, according to the custom of the Jews. And when Jesus was twelve years old they went up as usual for the festival. When the festival was over and they started to return, the child Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it. Then they started to look for him among their relatives and friends. When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for him. After three days they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.

“ Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in great anxiety”

“Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?"

34

But they did not understand what he said to them. His mothertreasured all these things in her heart. Jesus, the Son of God came to this world to fulfill God’s plan of Salvation. Even from his childhood he was always ready to fulfill God’s will. We, the children of God, have received an invitation to make God known to the people of the world. In response to that invitation we are all bound to make God known to the world even from our childhood. To do this we have to follow the example of the child Jesus Mary and Joseph who went in search of the child Jesus who stayed behind in the temple of Jerusalem gave a good example to the parents that they should be more alert about their children.

The growth of Jesus

St. Luke in his Gospal tell's us how Jesus grew in his childhood

Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. His mother treasured all these things in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and in years, and in divine and human favor. (Luke 2:51-52)

How Jesus grew

35

St. Luke tells us that from his early childhood Jesus did God’s will and he increased in wisdom and grace. As a child he was in the temple sitting among the teachers listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and at his answers. From all these incidents we can understand how Jesus grew in wisdom and grace. Though he was the Son of God, Jesus was always obedient to his parents, and helped them in their daily tasks in the house. So he grew in physical strength.Jesus together with his parents, Mary and Joseph prayed to his heavenly Father and was always busy with religious duties.eg. The parents of Jesus took him to the temple of Jerusalem to be offered to God.When Jesus was twelve years old they took him to the temple of Jerusalem for the Passover festival. Jesus helped his parents and others and always respected the laws of the society. So everybody was pleased with him. So, as St. Luke says, Jesus increased in favour with God and men. St. Luke has summed up Jesus' personality development in that sentence; that Jesus increased in wisdom and in

years and in divine and human favour.Like Jesus we too must grow in personality. We must grow mentally, physically, spiritually and socially. To grow mentally we must study well and read good books and magazine and try to get information from various sources and be knowledgeable and intelligent. To be physically strong we must eat nourishing food, do physical exercises and play games and also take rest. To grow spiritually we must spend sometime with God daily in prayer; perform religious exercises. We must participate in the Holy Mass on Sundays. We can grow socially when we live in harmony with everybody at home, in school, in the parish and in the village or town. Taking the Child Jesus as our example let us try to help your parents at home, take part in Sramadana and other common work in school and in the village, and participate in the work of the parish. Doing things in whatever way, we can grow socially. Then we, like Jesus will increase in mind and body, and spiritually and socially.

9 The Sacraments

Picture 9.1 - Holy Eucharist in a monstrance

Accordingly, there are four characteristic marks in a Sacrament. We can explain these four characteristics taking for example the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist.1. A visible sign - hosts and wine 2. The gift of grace - receiving the body and blood of Jesus Christ 3. Instituted by Christ - At the Last Supper on Holy Thursday by Jesus Christ.4. The liturgical Service - The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.

Every Sacrament is an encounter with the Risen Lord. So then a Sacrament is a visible sign, signifying the gift of God's grace instituted by Jesus Christ. Almost all the Sacraments are given in a liturgical service.

When we receive the Holy Eucharist we receive the Body and Blood of Jesus. By receiving the body and blood of Christ we believe that our spiritual life is nourished. That is the gift of grace that we receive inwardly. Jesus instituted the Holy Eucharist at the Last Supper on Holy Thursday. The bread and wine that Jesus used at the Last Supper are visible signs of the Sacrament of

38

There is thus a resemblance between the stages of the natural life and the stages of the spiritual life' Through the Sacraments Jesus Christ gives us grace. We should receive them with our own free will and with a good knowledge and understanding about the Sacrament we receive. All those who are baptised should receive the other Sacraments at the proper age and at the suitable time. We can categorise the Seven Sacra-ments as follows:

There are seven Sacraments, the picture below shows the Seven Sacraments.

The Seven Sacraments touch all the stages and all the important moments of Christian Life.

 Birth - Baptism

 Nourishment - Holy Eucharist

 Adult hood - Confirmation

 Vocation - Matrimony/Holy Orders

 Healing - Reconciliation and Sacrament of the sick

Picture 10.5 - Anointing with Chrism 2. Confirmation

The disciples were all together in one place. Suddenly there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind , and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Parted tongues of fire appeared among them. These rested on each of the apostles. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in diverse tongues as the Spirit gave them the ability. Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem, and at this sound the crowd gathered was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in their native language. On Pentecost Sunday, they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and on hearing the apostle Peter's sermon, three thousand people were baptised and they became Christians.

On the day of the Pentecost

45

The Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles on Pentecost Sunday. In the same way the Holy Spirit will descend upon all those who receive the Sacrament of Confirmation. We must pray and implore the blessings of the Holy Spirit before we begin our work, our studies or any other activity. The Holy Spirit will enlighten us, give us power and his strength to do everything well. The reception of the Sacrament of the Confirmation is necessary for the completion of the baptismal grace. By the Sacrament of Confirmation, the baptized are more perfectly bound to the Church and are enriched with a special strength of the Holy Spirit. They become mature Christians and bear witness to Christ by word and deed. 3. Holy Eucharist

Picture 10.6 - The Last Supper

By the words that Jesus uttered at the Last Supper Jesus instituted the Sacrament of the Holy Euchrist. The Sacraments of Initiation come to completion when receiving the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist.

Then he took a loaf of bread and after he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them saying "This is my body which is given for you. Do this in rememberance of me" (Luke 22:19)

The Eucharistic Miracle of Lanciano, Italy

Picture 10.7 - Holy Eucharist

Result of the Scientific test in 1574

In February 1574 Monsignor Rodrigues verified in the presence of reputable witnesses that the combined weight of the five pellets of frozen blood was equal to the individual weight of any of them, a fact that was later memorized by being kept in a marble tablet in 1636. This place is still located in the Church.

Time of the miracle - In the year 700 A.D.

The place of -the miracle

The miracle -

In Italy, in a monastry named after St. Longinus (The Roman soldier who pierced the side of Jesus)

A priest monk who had doubts about the change of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, had just spoken the solemn words of con-secreation, when the host was suddenly changed into a circle of flesh and the wine was transformed into visible blood.

The result of the medical scientific experiments in March 4th 1971 by Professor Linoli

• The flesh was identified as muscular tissue of the human heart.• The blood and the flesh were found to belong to the same blood group AB positive.

47

The findings of 1970 experiments

After Scienctific experiments done by the Naza Institute, it was revealed that the blood in the Holy Shroud of Turin and the blood in the piece of flesh in the Lanciano miracle, belong to the same group of blood. The blood group is AB Positive

Activity1. How do you develop the new life you have received from Baptism?2. Write five things that you learnt from the incidents that happened on Pentecost Sunday.

So we have enough of evidence to prove that Jesus is really and truly present in the Holy Eucharist. Hence we must receive Jesus regularly with faith. love and with due reverence. By receiving Holy Communion our spiritual life is nourished and we receive grace upon grace.

• The blood contained the minerals that is found in human new and fresh blood. Minerals such as Calcium, and of Proteins.• No preservative was found inserted to keep it always fresh and new.• Though the flesh and blood were exposed to the influence of the physical atmosphere for nearly 12 centuries no sign of decay is noticed.

Picture 11.2 - Making Confession

The Sacrament of Reconciliation or Penance is the Sacrament instituted by Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins committed by a person after his Baptism. A person, who due to serious sin, loses his state of grace. God’s friendship is Reconciled and brought back to God’s friendship by the Sacrament of reconciliation.

Institution of the Sacrament of ReconciliationAfter his resurrection, on the evening of Easter Sunday he appeared to his apostles and saying the words of the Holy Scripture stated below gave them the power to forgive sins to his apostles and instituted the Sacrament of Reconciliation.

“Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven. If you retain the sins of any they are retained.”

(John 20:22-23)

50

Graces received through he Sacrament of Reconciliation

Confession is essential for those who have fallen into mortal sin after baptism. If we fall into mortal sin we should immediately beg God’s forgiveness by an act of contrition and approach the confessional at the earliest. Even if we are not in mortal sin, it is advisable to make one's confession from time, to time, for our venial sins. When we do so, we obtain forgiveness for our sins and gain strength to avoid sin.

* Jesus forgives our sins* He removes eternal punishment* We regain sanctifying grace* We receive the strength to avoid sin* We are reconciled to God and to our neighbour

In order to make a good confession there are five things we need to do1. Examine your conscience2. Be sorry for your sins3. Make a firm resolution not to sin again4. Confess your sins to a priest5. Do the penance given by the priest

Jesus Christ instituted two sacraments for this purpose

12 The Sacraments of Service

These two Sacraments build up God’s people. The priest fulfils it in the parish and the parents fulfill it in the home by cultivating a good environment in the parish and at home they perform their duties by doing their service and obligations as promised on the day of their ordination and marriage.

Priesthood

Picture 12.1 - Offering Holy Mass

1. Holy Orders (Priesthood)

2. Holy Matrimony

Jesus Christ instituted the Sacrament of Holy Order to continue the mission entrusted to the apostles until the end of the world.

It is a contract between a man and a women with the intention of procreating children and accepting responsibility before God to build up a good Christian family. God endorses this promise, blesses this union and grants abundant graces to fulfill the obligations of family life. Catholic marriage is a contract and also a sacrament.

Lord Jesus Christ on Holy Thursday saying the following words instituted the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist.

54

• Preaching the Word of God• To be a true shepherd• Offering the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass• Administer the Sacraments.• A priest acts as a mediator between God and man• He offers to God the prayers and adoration of the people of God.• He obtains God’s mercy and blessings on the people.• He blesses the people• He conducts the Daham Pasala• He teaches the religion• He conducts funeral services• He Visits homes and Families• He helps the poor.

The services of the Priests.

It is our duty to help the priests to do their various responsible tasks. Hence let us help the priests in whatever way we are able. The pictures below show us a few such instances.

“ Then he took a loaf of bread and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me ” (Luke 22:19)

The Sacrament that was instituted by Jesus Christ at the last supper is continuously commemorated everyday by the priests by offering the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. The Sacrament of Holy Orders imprints an indelible mark on the soul of the priest. Therefore they can receive this sacrament of Holy Orders only once in a life time.

Duties and responsibilities of children towards their parents

Sirach 3:12-16• My child, help your father in his old age.• Do not grieve him as long as he lives.• Even if his mind fails, be patient with him.• Do not despise him• Do not make your mother angry.

Sirach 7:27-28• With all your heart honour your father.• Do not forget the birth paings of your mother.• Remember that it was of your parents you

were born. How can you repay what they have given to you

Colossians 3:20 • Children obey your parents in everything

Ephesians 6:1-2• Children obey your parents in the Lord• Honour your father and mother

Then the Lord said “ It is not good that the man should be alone. I will make him a helper as his partner”

(Genesis 2:19)

Picture 12.7 - Paying homage to the parents

Look at this picture. You can see two children paying homage to their parents. We too must pay our respect to our parents. They have given their whole life for us. Therefore we must help them whenever we can. As students we must do our studies well so that they will be happy. We must always behave well at home, so that there will be peace at home, because they gave us life, they fed us with good food. They spent for our education. They lead us to God by helping us to do our religious duties. They always make us go on the right path by their good example.

14 Love of God

Picture 14.1

Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were in the furnace

without burning.

A long time ago, there was a great powerful king named Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. He was a King, who did not believe in the God of Israel, but believed in other mythical pagan gods.

Once he asked his servants to make a golden statue and set it up at the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. Then the King gave orders to all his citizens to worship that statue, and he also

declared, if anyone who does not bow down and worship the statue, he will immediately be thrown in to a blazing furnace.

But there were three brothers, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego who were Jews, loved and worshiped whole heartedly the one and only God. These three brothers refused to worship the golden statue of king Nebuchandnezzar. Then king Nebuchadnezzar lost

62

Today we are worshipping the same God who rescued them from the fire. At the same time we are directed to adore God alone, by the first Commandment. This is a good guidance to those who give their worship to trees, statues, models of animals and other different things, in the present society.

We should offer our supreme worship to God. The same God who rescued Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego will stay with us, and protect us from all evil then we can be sure that we are receiving the holy power of God, to overcome from all the challenges we are facing in our life.

There are three commands of God which directs us to worship God alone, out of them two are :

1. Thou shalt worship God alone2. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord your God in vain

his temper and ordered his men to heat the furnace seven times hotter than usual, and throw these brothers into the blazing furnace and kill them. Those who took them into the furnace were killed by the flames which came out of

the furnace but none of these three brothers got hurt with fire, not even a single hair of theirs was burnt. The king and the others who were around there, saw those three brothers walking in the midst of the furnace. (Daniel 3)

We will turn our attention to these two Commandments, which are mentioned in the book of Deutroronomy

63

"worship no God, but me. Do not make for yourselves images of anything in heaven or on earth or in the water under the earth. Do not bow down to any idol or worship it ................. "Do not use my name for evil purposes for I the Lord your God, will punish anyone who misuses my name.

(Deut. 5:7-9,11)

Picture 14.2 - People who adore their God

alone.

We, who are Christians should observe these commandments of God which is in the sacred scriptures By doing that we can offer our selves and love to the supreme God. Therefore we will keep the first and second commandments in our minds.

and offer Him supreme worship.Pray everyday, by praising and worshipping God, before starting any work.• Keep trusting in

God the Father in every challenge in life. • Be faithful to God

the Father, until we die.

• Adoring or worshipping a person or a thing.• Believing in other gods.• Idol worshipping.• Idolatrous practices like, amulets, charms, spells, charmed oils and threads. • Belief in auspicious times, light reading, signs of good and bad times.• participating in the practices of non-Christian religions.

65

We learned, from the verses 5:7-8 of the book of Deutroronomy, that we should not adore any person or a thing and consider God as the Father.

The statues of saints help us to pray. Those images help us to bring that relevant person into our minds. But saints can only pray for us. Because they intercede before God, we pray or make promises in front of statues.

God the Father is the only one who can and who is providing all our needs. At the same time, saints are giving a valuable example to us, for our Journey towards heaven. Because of that, all the pious devotions, we are doing towards saints should be done, only to give them honour or respect.

Also doing rituals and observing beliefs of non-christian religions, making oaths and worshipping are sins against the second commandment. In the Holy Scripture it is written, that the idolatrous practices and idol worshipping are abomination to the Lord.

The Lord God who is protecting you and me, had protected our forefathers and the people of God since the beginning of the world and in the past. That was wonderfully explained in the several places in the Holy Scripture, especially the book of 'Exodus' is one of the best example for that. We can be sure as it was in the past even today. God the Father is protecting you and me.

CommandmentsWhat we should doWhat we should not doSecond Commandment

Come and enter into the house of God Singing and praising his glory Lord our God loved us all Let us thank him for His goodness.

Picture 15.1 - Parishoners, Participating the Holy Eucharist

2 Saved us from sin - by his cross Eternal happiness brought into our lives Let us celebrate that great sacrifice Singing and worshipping with reverance Tune Edlewise

69

From the hymn.1 Where do you have to enter according to that invitation?2 What kind of task, were you asked to do by that invitation?3 Give two reasons why we should sing and play instruments to worship God ?4 What kind of inheritance has Jesus brought us through his sacrifice on the cross.5 What is the day, that the parish community must gather together to praise, thank and worship God.

Observe the sabbath and keep it holy. You have six days in which to do your work, but the seventh day is a day of rest dedicated to me. On that day no one is to work neither you, your children, your slaves, your animals, nor the foreigners who live in your country. In six days I the Lord made the earth, the sky, the sea and everything in them, but on the seventh day I rested. That is why I, the Lord, blessed the sabbath and made it holy.

Exodus. 20:8-11

Keep holy the sunday and other days of obligation

According to this commandment, we are obliged to participate in the Holy Mass, on all Sundays and on the days of obligation, which is demanded by the Catholic Church. Therefore it is important to know about the days of obligation.

70

The days observed as days of obligation in

Sri Lanka

We commemorate the Paschal Mystery, specially on Sundays. It is the suffering death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, for the atonement of the sins of all mankind. Jesus shed His blood and brought us forgiveness for our sins, and the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven, through his infinite sacrifice.

Because of the forgiveness we have received, we must participate in the Sunday Holy Mass joyfully as one parish family, united in one mind.

God loved us so much, sent his only Son, to bring victory over death. Therefore we all must thank, praise and worship God our Father and Jesus Christ, who gave his life to redeem us. It is the main objective of the Sunday Mass.

God expects us to live a holy and righteous life. Therefore let us see the ways in which we can express our gratitude to God our Father, who created us and provides us everything for our lives.

16 Neighbourly Love

We all like to live in unity and happily with different people, who are in our families, school and in our society.

Let's sing this Hymn

Chorus Love one another Warm as brotherly love Live a life of unity Enjoy peace in the Lord 1 Eager to show respect to others more than to you Respect your neighbours leaving your proud thoughts work hard with courage and do not ever be lazy Serve the Lord God with a heart full of great devotion

2 In your happy days be joyful without being proud In your troublesome days be patient without being discouraged Do not ever forget the constant prayer to God Lend your helping hand to all those who need your love.

Picture 17.1 - Jesus who sacrificed His life on the cross

83

3 Spread the God's peace among those who are persecuting you If someone does you wrong do not repay him with a wrong Be happy with a smile when there is laughter and joy Be concerned of their pain and weep with those who are weeping among you

Among those points, some say to forgive our enemies and for those who persecute us. Let us inquire about the scripture passage, which tells us, how we should love our enemies.

"You have heard that it was said an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But now I tell you, do not take revenge on someone who does wrong to you, if any one slaps you, on your right cheek, let him slap your left cheek too. and if someone takes you to court to sue you for your shirt, let him have your coat as well, and if one of the occupation troops, forces to carry his pack one kilometre, carry it two kilometres. When someone asks you for something, give it to him, when someone wants to borrow something lend it. (Mathew 5:38-41)

There is no difficulty to love those who love us. But it is difficulf to love those who harm and persecute us. But the above scripture passages tell us, that we should forgive our enemies. It clearly says that we should not take revenge at all.

All receive God's love, blessings and mercy. He loves all of us, very much. Jesus taught us that we must love our enemies, as our Heavenly Father does.

Read the hymn and make two seperate lists, (i) the good things that you should add to your life. (ii) the bad things that you should keep away from your life.

84

"you have heard that it was said, love your friends, hate your enemies. But now I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may become the sons of your Father in Heaven. For he makes his sun to shine on bad and good people alike, and gives rain to those who do good and to those who do evil. Why should God reward you, if you love only the peope who love you ? Even the tax collectors do that ! And if you speak only to your friends, have you done anything out of the ordinary? Even the pagans do that ! You must be perfect - just as your Father in Heaven is perfect. (Matthew 5:43-48)

According to the above teaching, the enemy who harms us should be loved by us whole heartedly. God our loving Father, loves the good and the bad equally. Therefore, we also should love our friends as well as our enemies, as our Heavenly Father does. Loving enemies is a difficult

task. But Jesus forgave those who mocked and insulted Him during the whole of His life. Finally they put Him to death by conspiracy.

Jesus said "Forgive them Father! They do not know what they are doing."

(Luke 23:34)

85

Picture 17.3 - Stoning and killing St. Stephem

Have you heard about St. Sephen, who was a follower of Jesus Christ, and how he forgave his enemies.

It states in the Holy Scripture. (Acts. 7:54-60) St. Stephen took the responsibility, and came foward to preach the true doctrine to the Jewish World. Because of that, he had to face persecution.

Can you remember, when did Jesus say these words? An event, where Jesus was hanging on the cross with wounds, at the moment he was sentenced to a shameful death forgetting everything, Jesus forgave whole heartedly those who mocked Him and drank wine to celebrate their victory. It was the great moment of great love, revealed to the whole world

Let us find out about some people who forgive their enemies like Jesus Christ.

Saint Stephen

86

'They kept on stoning Stephen, as he called out to the Lord, "Lord Jesus receive my spirit" Lord! Do not remember this sin against them" he said this and died.'

(Acts 7:59-60)

Pope John Paul II, forgave his assasinator. That attempt was done by a person name Ali Agqua. He failed in his attempt, and the Pope was saved. But Ali was a sentenced and put into the jail. Pope John Paul II who visited Ali Agqua at his prison cell, hugged him with love, and forgave him whole heartedly.

Pope John Paul II

by forgiving his enemies. Surely you can also become a blessed child. By forgiving you can experience a new life, filled with love.

Following the way that Jesus showed, Pope John Paul showed the world, how we should love our enemies. Try yourself to forgive your enemies. Try to become a child pleasing to God by forgiving your enemies.

Always remember the example that Jesus gave Picture 17.4 - Pope John Paul II forgives Ail Agqua

18 Precepts of the Church

They are -:

1. Attend mass on Sundays and Holy days of obligation.2. Receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation, at least once a year.3. Receive Holy Communion at least once, during the Easter season4. Observe the days of fasting and abstinence, established by the church 5. Provide for the needs of the church.

The catholics who live in every country of the world, are members of the Catholic Church. It is the bounden duty and the responsibility of the church leaders, to guide these members in the correct path, according to God's word.

Apart from the Ten Commandments, the law which the church has set, to guide the people on the correct path is named as the the Precepts of the Church. There are five Precepts:

1. Attend Mass on Sunday and Holy days of obligation.

As people of God, the sacrifice we are offering to God is Holy Mass. It is a bounden duty and an obligation of the people of God, to attend Holy Mass on Sunday and on the days of obligation.

To fulfill this obligation, it is necessary, that they should participate in the Holy Mass fully. It means, they should give active

participation, from the entrance hymn to the final hymn, of the Mass

When we are participating in the Mass actively, it is good to refrain from unnecessary chatting which obstruct the concentration. Therefore we must participate at the Holy Mass whole heartedly. For that we should join in prayers,

89

hymns and the responses for the community prayers.

This obligation does not bind for persons who are seriously ill, living far away from a church, engage in essential services, and similar circumstances. Otherwise all christians, who are above seven years of age, should observe this precept. However, those who are

released from this obligation, should try to attend a prayer service, other devotion or engage in private prayer.

We should not consider the Sunday obligation as a burden imposed on us. It is the expression of our love and gratitude to God for his loving kindness, showed towards us

We commit sins in the society we are living in. We sin with our knowledge, wilfully, or we sin through ignorance.

Because of our failures, wrong doings and sinful life, we break our relationships with God, our own brothers, sisters and our neighbours. Sometimes we may break our fellowship with others.

When we commit a mortal sin or a grevious fault, we must receive forgiveness, by going to confession. Because of that, the obligation of confession at least once a year, should be fulfilled by us.

Even if we don't have a mortal sin to confess, it is necessary to go to Confession at least once a year.

Because of the people's fear to receive Holy communion, this precept was introduced, in the past. But today our Holy mother Church teaches us to receive Holy communion at every Eucharistic

Celebration and also the Church says: if we want to receive the full benefits the blessings of the Holy Mass, we have to receive Holy Communion during that same Mass.

2. Receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation at least once a year

3. Receive Holy Communion at least once during the Easter season

90

 Abstinence

Abstinence means, abstain from eating meat of the creatures who are living on the earth, on the days prescribed by the Church. Those days are

●●Ash wednesday●●Good friday●●All Fridays of the year

 Fasting

Fasting here implies, taking only one full meal a day. Other two meals can be omitted or a light diet could be taken for the other two meals. The church establishes these days:

●●As penance for our sins●●To train us to mortify our senses ●●To make us imitate Christ, who was fasting for forty days in the desert.

The church strongly encourages us to fast and to engage in acts of alms giving of the food we collect from our fasting. The church teaches us to share that meal with a person who needs food. Therefore, giving alms is the main objective of fasting

Fasting binds only those Catholics who have completed 18 years of age and under 60 years of age. But all are encouraged to fast voluntaily.

Every although Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are recommended by the Church as the days of fasting, Catholics can fast on any other day voluntarily.

4. Observe the days of fasting and abstinence, es tablished by the Church

91

To maintain the stability of an institution or an organization, it is common, that the members contribute something for its maintenance. In the same way this precept of the Catholic Church asks its members to give of their help to provide for the needs of the

church according to their ability.

Maintaining the churches, providing the material needs of the clergy and for the different charitable works of the parish, these contributions help.

5. You shall help to provide for the needs of the church.

1. Name the five precepts of the church.2. Write three things you can do to participate in the Holy Mass actively.3. Write separately (a) the days of abstinence & (b) the days of fasting.4. Describe what is fasting?5. What are the forbidden days for a catholic marriage?

Activity

For LifeLet us participate at the Holy Mass fully on Sundays and the days of obligation We go to the Sacrament of Reconciliation at least once a year Let us fast on the recommended days.

Mother :

Doctor ....... Why did you call us.

Come, Come sit down. I asked you to come to speak about Damian, his condition is not good. As doctors,we did our best.

Oh,.... God! Our only son.

Don't get upset, I can understand your situation.If Damian can show us any good response within the next twentyfour hours, we can do something and make your son live.That is what I wanted to convey to you.

Lets get together and pray.I can trust in God, He will never give any pain or sorrow to us (they left the doctor, and started to pray without ceasing and a few hours later, the Doctor came towards them with a smile.)

Good news! It's a miracle, now we can do something and make your son live.

Thanks be to God! I ....... believed our prayers will be heard by Him. (turns towards mother) when we return home, the first things we will take our son to the church.

Yes..... yes ....... even I thought. We shall do it that way. We will pray with our son more than other days.

93

Prayer is an important part of our christian life As the bark is attached to the tree, prayer also should be attached and be a part of our christian life.

Prayer is a personal conversation with God being bound with love. Therefore with great devotion and concentration, we should pray to God. It is not necessary to have a set of memorized words to do this.It is more profitable to speak to God with our thoughts, that turned in to words, that come from the depths of our hearts.

Prayer is

Lifting up of our minds and hearts to God in worship, praise and thanksgiving and asking God for our daily needs.

(C.F.C 291)

There are four kinds of prayer.

1. Praise 2. Thanksgiving 3. Pleading for forgiveness 4. Pleading for graces and blessings. (C.F.C 293)

We christians, always try to engage in prayer to maintain a good relationship with God. When we pray, we praise, thank, ask for forgiveness for our sins and plead for graces and blessings from God.

Through parables, Christ taught and showed us how much more the Father in heaven gives good things to those who ask Him; therefore, He advises us to pray to God, without getting discouraged.

94

The parable of the friend who came at mid night - (Luke 11:5-8)

The parable of the unjust judge (Luke 18:1-8)

Picture 19.1Picture 19.2

• Open your Holy Bible and read the above mentioned parables.

Parable of the pharisee and the tax collector.

Jesus told this parable,to people who were sure of their own goodness and despised everybody else."Once there were two men,who went up to the temple to pray.One was a Pharisee,the other a tax collector.

"The Pharisee stood apart by himself and prayed,I thank you God,that I am not greedy,dishonest or an adulterer like everybody else.I thank you that I am not like that tax collector over there. I fast two days a week and I give you a tenth of all my income".

"But the tax collector stood at a distance,and would not even raise his face to heaven,but beat his breast and said 'God have pity on me' a sinner!" "I tell you" said Jesus,the tax collector and not the Pharisee,was in the right with God when he went home.For everyone who makes himself great,will be humble and every one who humbles himself will be made great.

Luke 18:9-14

95

When we pray

• We should not boast about ourselves, because God knows us very well. • We should not compare ourselves wih others.• We should not despise others.• We should accept our sins and our failiures.• We should pray humbly'

When we pray, as christians we use different postures.They are raising our hands, joining hands and keeping them in front of our chest,worship by keeping hands on the forehead etc. Through these postures, we extend our devotion and humility to God,and also show,our praises which belongs to Him.

Therefore, when we pray we should be concerned about using the correct postures,and offer our praises always to God.

From the parable of the Pharisee and the Tax collector the above advice was shown to us, by Jesus.

Activity

20 The Times of Prayer

After his last supper,Jesus went out to the Mount of Olives,with his disciples. Jesus knew, 'Judas', the one who shared everything with Him,will betray Him the next moment, and hand him over to the chief priests. Jesus will have to undergo much suffering. Grief and anguish overcame Him and troubled him.He knelt down and prayed to his Father.

Father, if you will, take this cup of suffering away from me. Not my will, however, but your will be done (Luke 22:42)

Picture 20.1 - Jesus Praying in Gethsamony

Prayer was a most important feature in the life of Jesus, when He was in sorrow, pain, loneliness and facing unsolved problems. Jesus found the answers through prayer. In that way, He was able to develop a strong relationship with God the Father. Even in His ministry,which was assigned to Him by the Father, Jesus was able to fulfill the task, through his constant prayer.

97

Some of the events where Jesus prayed.

 At the time of his Baptism

 Before he healed many diseases

Before he chose his disciples.

Jesus prayed, after he was baptized

(Luke 3:21)

Jesus went away to lonely places where he prayed.

(Luke5:16)

At that time, Jesus went up a hill,to pray and spent the whole night there,praying to God'

One day Jesus was praying in a certain place.When he had finished, one of his discriples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray''

(Luke 11:1)

On the cross, Jesus prayed and said

"Forgive them Father, They don't know what they are doing"

(Luke 23:34)

"Father ! Into your hands, I commend my spirit"

(Luke 23:46)

As christians we should practice the wonderful example which Jesus gave us to show the value of prayer.

Human life survives on the respiratory system. If any difficulty occurs to this system,we have to bid farewel and get ready for our last journey. Similary, prayer life is also very essential to our christian life.

Through that prayer life, we can

see God's will for us and at the same time,we can satisfy and our fulfill our needs with God's blessings.

When we separate ourselves from our prayer life, we have also to separate from God. Then we become weak spiritually and ruin our christian values. Hence, let us pray daily to keep and secure our prayer life as a very essential part of our life.

Through this prayer - We are

Thanking the heavenly Father for keeping us away from death and all evil the night before.

Promising God the Father, to live according to his commandments and do good, in our thoughts, words and deeds on the new day He has given us.

21 The Lord's Prayer

One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. when he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples. He listened to their pleading and said "When you pray, say this" and taught them the Lord's prayer.

As this prayer was taught and handed to us by our Lord Jesus, we name this as the "LORD'S PRAYER". At the same time we name it as, 'Our Father' too. This prayer that Jesus taught, was:

Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread And forgive us our trespasses As we forgive those who trespass againts us. And lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from evil.

According to the "Lords Prayer", we find some important topics which should be in a prayer. They are:

Picture 21.1 - Jesus teaches the Apostles the 'Our Father'

105

Characteristic of PrayerLord's Prayer

PraiseHallowed be thy name !

Divine WorshipThy kingdom come !Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heav-en !

Petition Give us this day our daily bread

RepentanceForgive us our tresspasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.

Giving ourselves to Divine Providence

Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.

In the Lord's prayer, our heavenly Father is addressed not as "My Father", but as "Our Father". When we say "Our Father" we can see, there is a communitarian aspect in it. Because of that, this prayer is used more in the Church in her Liturgical services. The best example for that is the Eucharistic Celebration; but most of the time, we use the Lord's prayer in our personal prayer.

Normally, when we pray, we keep

our hands joined, but when we say the Lord's prayer, we do not use the common posture. Instead, Mother Church invites us to spread out and raise our hands.

We must recite the Lord's prayer with this posture.

In the Lord's prayer there are three acts of praise and four petitions of physical and spiritual needs.

1. Act of Praise

(1) Hallowed be Thy name • We praise the Holy Name of God,

who created every thing.

106

2. Petitions of physical and spiritual needs.

(1) Give us this day our daily bread

• As God provided 'Manna' to the people of Israel, in their flight

from Eygpt to the promised land, we too ask God to provide us with our daily bread. We also ask God to give us our spiritual sustenance through the word of God, and the Holy Eucharist.

(2) Thy kingdom come • The final hope of every christian is to

enter the kingdom of God. Our wish in this life is, to establish the kingdom of God on Earth,(3) Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven

• The will of God reigns not only in heaven, but also on earth. That

is our wish.

(2) Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass

against us.• We should forgive others their wrongdoings and negligence

against us. God will also forgive us in the same measure. That is are prayer in this petition.

(3) Lead us not into temptation

• We ask God to keep us away from all actions forbidden by the

ten commandments.

(4) Deliver us from evil

• We ask God to protect us from all physical and spiritual dangers.

Through these praise intentions and the petitions of spiritual and physical needs, we offer our heart's praise and honour to God our Father. At the same time, we make a wish to establish his kingdom on earth, where justice. prevails. We also ask God's guidance, to understand in the correct way and to go on the path of righteousness, with physical and spiritual strength.

22 The Hail Mary

Appearance of Mother

Mary to Father Dominic Gusman

In the begining of the 13th century, there were many conspiracies and various powers acting against the Christians who lived in Italy and Southern France. Their faith was attacked. A Spanish Priest, Father Dominic Gusman, was sad at this pathetic situation. He

prayed and made sacrifices for three days asking God to change this situation. It was in a place near Toulouse. At the end of the third day, Mother Mary appeared to him carrying a rosary in her hand and with two angels, and said to Dominic.

Mother : Mary

Dominic :

Mother : Mary

Dominic what is the weapon that the Holy Trinity is using to reform the world ?

Oh! Mother Mary, in the plan of salvation, you have a place near your Son, so you know about it, better than I do.

Reachout to the hardhearted people and win them over with the power of my rosary.

Mother Mary's appearence at Fatima

Francis and Jacintha, two siblings, and another cousin, Lucy lived in Fatima in Spain. These children had to look after the flocks, which belonged to their families. One Sunday the 13th of May in 1917, while they were watching the flocks, suddenly the whole place was illumined with a great light. The children who feared this incident wanted to leave the place, but on a nearby oak bush, they saw a beautiful woman. She is sitting and looking at them. She had a rosary in her hand, and said, "Do not be afraid, I will not do any harm to you" Lucy the cousin, was bold enough to question her, "Where did you come from?" "I came from Heaven" she revealed to Lucy. Finally the Lady asked them to intercede for the sinners of the world and pray, to change their hearts. Before she disappeared. she said "Say the rosary, say it correctly."

Apparition at Lourdes.

In 11th of February 1858, a young girl called Bernadette, her sister and a friend, went to the woods, which was situated near a little brook, flowing in the town of Lourdes. When Bernadette removed one of her shoes to wade across, the river, a peculiar stir of wind caused her to look up, towards Massabielle a

mound of rock. that served as a town dump.

In a little grotto, aglow with golden light, there stood a lovely young lady. It was a strange experience for Bernadette. She said, "The Lady looked at me for sometime, bowed and smiled at me quite graciously. She gave a sign and asked me to come closer. A mysterious weakness came over me, I forgot where I was, I closed my eyes, again I opened them, the lady was there looking at me. For a moment, we looked at each other in silence. I fumbled for my rosary from the pocket and knelt down. At that moment, the young lady held up a rosary of her own. When I recited the rosary, gradually her rosary slipped away from her hand. The next moment, with a cloud, she disappeared into the Grotto." (From the book "The collection of Apparitions-by the Father Joseph Jayasuriya)

Eachtime when Mother Mary appeared, she pleaded to each and every person, to recite the Holy Rosary. When we recite the holy rosary we say "Hail Mary". It has three parts.

1. The first part of this prayer is based on the Annunciation story. (Luke 1:26-38) "Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and Blessed is the fruit, of thy womb Jesus".2. The second part of Hail Mary is based on the The greetings of Elezabeth when our Lady visited her after the annunciation (Luke 1:42) 3. "Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death" - Amen.

"I am the hand maid of the Lord be it done unto me according to thy word" by saying this, Mother Mary accepted the will of God, and lived a life to do God's will always until the end; because of her great contri-bution to the salvation plan, she was called "blessed" and crowned as the Mother of the Church.• Several Feasts of Mother Mary, are celebrating during the Liturgical year.

111

Eg: • Feast of Mary Mother of God - (01st of January)• Feast of the Assumption of Mother Mary - (15th of August)• Feast of the Immaculate Conception of Mother Mary - (08th of December)

• Several prayers, hymns, popular devotions give priority and honour to Mother Mary.• Several Churches have been dedicated to Mother Mary' (some as shrines) and celebrate the Feasts annually. Eg. Our Lady of Lanka, Our Lady of Matara, Our Lady of Perpetual Help

Even among the saints, the highest honour is given to Mother Mary so we must give our heartfelt gratitude, honour and respect to Mother Mary in every moment at our life.

23 Common Prayers

Prayer is a friendly and loving conversation we have with God. To have this conversation there are two methods:

1. Using a prayer that we have memorized2. Using our own formulated prayer

We can express our own feelings which come from the heart to God, through prayers we have learnt by heart or made on our own. Thus we can improve our relationship with God. It paves the way for a deep life of prayer.

The formal prayers given by the Church are very useful for us, untill we get used to our own form of prayers. There are many benefits from these prayers:

24 Recognizing the different

forms of Prayer

Prayer is to lift up our hearts and minds to God, in praising, worshipping and thanking and asking our needs from Him. Prayer is a loving and friendly conversation, we have with God. Spontaneous prayer which comes from our heart, is more meaningful and fruitful than the prayers we say by memory.

We must pray to God, at different moments, for the creation, what is seen and unseen. For that we must know the different forms of prayers.

1. Prayer of Praise - the prayer we say to Praise God. Eg. The Eucharistic prayer of the Holy Mass2. Prayer of Thanks giving - prayers to thank God for spritual and temporal benefits.3. Prayer of asking for forgiveness - prayers asking God's Mercy to forgive our sins.4. Prayer of Petition - presting our material and spiritual needs and asking God to help us.

It is our duty to respect God to praise Him, We and all that belongs to us proclaims God's glory. Hence we must praise and thank Him.

Likewise, that we should show our gratitude and thank God for the creation, our parents and all things we have received.

Very often we do wrong and offend God. For all these things, we must ask pardon and forgiveness from God.

120

We must also ask God for the things that we need. God knows, what we want. When we ask things from him it shows that we place our trust and hope in God.

We must pray for others too, but when we pray, we should wish that God's will be done in us, when we ask something from God. He gives only what is good for us.

The Book of Psalms is the prayer book of the Old Testament. All forms of prayers, mentioned above are included in those psalms. Here are some examples. We can imitate them, to learn how we should prayi. A prayer to praise God (Psalm 150) "Praise the Lord ! Praise God in his Temple ! Praise his strength in heaven Praise him for the mighty things he has done Praise his supreme greatness

Praise him with Trumpets Praise him with harp and lyre"

ii. A prayer to thank God (Psalm 92) How good it is to give thanks to you, O Lord, To sing in your honour, O Most High God, To proclaim your constant love every morning And your faithfulness every night

iii. A prayer to ask Forgiveness (Psalm 51) Be merciful to me, O God, - Because of your constant love Because of your great mercy - wipe away my sins! Wash away all my evil - and make me clean from my sin!

I recognize my faults; I am always conscious of my sins I have sinned only against you - only against you And what you consider evil

121

iv. A prayer of petition (psalm 5) Listen to my words, O Lord, And hear my sighs, Listen to my cry for help, My God and King I pray to you, O Lord; You hear my voice in the morning; At sunrise I offer my prayers And wait for your answer

 Open your Bibles and read the entire psalms, mentioned above.
