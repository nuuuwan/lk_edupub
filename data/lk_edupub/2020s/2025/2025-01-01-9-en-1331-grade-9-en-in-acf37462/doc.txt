Foreword

The educational objectives of the contemporary world are becoming more complex along

with the economic, social, cultural and technological development. The learning and teaching

process too is changing in relation to human experiences, technological differences, research

and new indices. Therefore, it is required to produce the textbook by including subject related

information according to the objectives in the syllabus in order to maintain the teaching

process by organizing learning experiences that suit to the learner needs. The textbook is not

merely a learning tool for the learner. It is a blessing that contributes to obtain a higher

education along with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop values and to obtain

learning experiences.

The government in its realization of the concept of free education has offered you all the

textbooks from grades 1-11. I would like to remind you that you should make the maximum

use of these textbooks and protect them well. I sincerely hope that this textbook would assist

you to obtain the expertise to become a virtuous citizen with a complete personality who

would be a valuable asset to the country.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial and writer boards as

well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department who have strived to offer this

textbook to you.

Using functions

To calculate the values in a range of cells, functions are used. After the ''='' symbol, to begin a formula, the function is included. Then the cell range is included within brackets. To indicate that it is a cell range, the names of the ﬁ rst cell and the last cell are written within and the symbol '':''.

Let us identify a few such functions;

To calculate the total sum in a cell range= sum(ﬁ rst cell:last cell).

To ﬁ nd the average in a cell range, = average(ﬁ rst cell:last cell).

To count the cells with numbers only = count(ﬁ rst cell:last cell).

To count cells with data in a cell range, use = counta(ﬁ rst cell:last cell).

Consider that, a school has four houses namely Metta, Karuna, Muditha and Upeksha. A flowchart to assign students to their houses is given below. Houses are assigned based on the remainder after dividing the admission number by 4.

Begin

Remainder = 0?

Remainder = 1?

Remainder = 2?

Show ''Karuna''

Show ''Muditha''

Sharing ﬁ le folder

²Consider an instance of sharing pictures, lessons, photographs, songs, video clips and the like among friends.

²To make this activity easy, let us ﬁ rst create folder named “Students Files’’ in the C drive of the hard disk.

(You may select a name of your choice for the ﬁ le).

²Copy into this folder, all pictures, photographs, songs, video clips and other ﬁ les for sharing purposes.

Note well : Login to the computer using an Administrator Account. The states of your account may not allow you for certain settings.

Therefore, your teacher will demonstrate this activity. The Operating system used for this activity is Windows 10.

Sending a message to all users in the network system

Let us learn how to send the message, ‘Hello, how are you?’ to all users in the network system.

²The same msg command is used in this case.

²In the previous activity you used the user name of receiver student 1 after msg command.

²However in here, instead of one user, * mark for 'all' is used.

²Therefore, the command you need to type is msg * Hello, how are you?

²Type correctly on the Command Interface and press Enter.

²All users of the network will receive the message. Use this command to send diﬀ erent messages.

Note: The activities were all with Windows 10 system. If you are using Windows 7 or those before it, type ‘net send’ command instead of ‘msg’ command.
