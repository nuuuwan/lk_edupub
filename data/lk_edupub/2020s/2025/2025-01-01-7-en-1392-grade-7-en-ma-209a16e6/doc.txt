Message of the Boards of Writers and Editors

This textbook has been compiled in accordance with the new syllabus which is to be implemented from 2016 for the use of grade seven students.

We made an effort to develop the attitude “We can master the subject of Mathematics well” in students.

In compiling this textbook, the necessity of developing the basic foundation of studying mathematical concepts in a formal manner was specially considered. This textbook is not just a learning tool which targets the tests held at school. It was compiled granting due consideration to it as a medium that develops logical thinking, correct vision and creativity in the child.

Furthermore, most of the activities, examples and exercises that are incorporated here are related to day to day experiences in order to establish mathematical concepts in the child. This will convince the child about the importance of mathematics in his or her daily life. Teachers who guide the children to utilize this textbook can prepare learning tools that suit the learning style and the level of the child based on the information provided here.

Learning outcomes are presented at the beginning of each lesson. A summary is provided at the end of each lesson to enable the child to revise the important facts relevant to the lesson. Furthermore, at the end of the set of lessons related to each term, a revision exercise has been provided to revise the tasks completed during that term.

Every child does not have the same capability in understanding mathematical concepts. Thus, it is necessary to direct the child from the known to the unknown according to his / her capabilities. We strongly believe that it can be carried out precisely by a professional teacher.

In the learning process, the child should be given ample time to think and practice problems on his or her own. Furthermore, opportunities should be given to practice mathematics without restricting the child to just the theoretical knowledge provided by mathematics.

Our firm wish is that our children act as intelligent citizens who think logically by studying mathematics with dedication.

1 Symmetry

By studying this lesson you will be able to

² identify plane figures with bilateral symmetry,² draw the axes of symmetry of a bilaterally symmetric figure, and² create bilaterally symmetric figures on square ruled paper.

1.1 Bilateral Symmetry

A figure of a blue quadrilateral shaped card is given here. By folding this figure along the dotted line, we obtain two parts that coincide on each other.

A few figures having two parts which coincide with each other when folded along a certain line are shown below.

Many of the objects in the environment have the property that they can be divided into two equal parts. Most creations too have this property which helps preserve their beauty. Let us learn more about plane figures and laminas with a plane figure as the boundary, that have this property.

In figure 1, there is only one line that divides the figure into two equal parts which coincide. However, each of the figures 2, 3 and 4, has more than one line that divides the figure into two parts which coincide.

Activity 1

Step 1 - Trace this figure onto a paper and cut along the border of the figure.

Step 2 - Fold the figure so that you get two equal parts which coincide as shown in figure 2.

Step 3 - Draw a dotted line along the fold. Now paste the figure in your exercise book.

Figure 1Figure 2

If a plane figure can be folded along a straight line so that you get two parts which coincide, then that plane figure is defined as a bilaterally symmetric plane figure. The line of folding is defined as an axis of symmetry of the figure.

Axis of symmetry

In the above activity you must have drawn the dotted line shown in the figure as the line along the fold. This line is an “axis of symmetry of the figure”. This bilaterally symmetric figure has only one axis of symmetry.

In a bilaterally symmetric figure, the two parts on either side of an axis of symmetry are of the same shape and of the same area.

The figure depicts a rectangle with a dotted line drawn across it. This line divides the rectangle into two equal parts. However if we fold the rectangle along the dotted line, the two parts will not coincide. Therefore this line is not an axis of symmetry of the figure.

A line through a plane figure which divides it into two parts of the same shape and of the same area which do not coincide with each other is not an axis of symmetry of the figure.

1.2 Drawing axes of symmetry

Step1 - Copy the figures given below on a piece of paper and cut out each lamina.

Step 2 - Find the bilaterally symmetric figures from the figures that were cut out.Step 3 - Draw all the axes of symmetry of the figures with bilateral symmetry.

Step 4 - Paste all the figures having axes of symmetry in your exercise book. Near each figure, write its number of axes of symmetry.

The axis of symmetry of this figure is the vertical line indicated by the dotted line. The points at which the straight line segments of a rectilinear plane figure meet are defined as the vertices of the plane figure. Usually the vertices are named using capital letters of the English alphabet.

The vertices A, B, C and D are on the right side of the axis of symmetry of the figure. Let us consider where the points A , B , C and D are located on the left side of the axis of symmetry.

The point A is located at a distance from the axis of symmetry which is equal to the distance from A to the axis of symmetry, on a horizontal line which passes through A. A is defined as the vertex corresponding to A.

Similarly, B , C and D are defined as the vertices corresponding to B, C and D respectively.

Let us consider how a bilaterally symmetric figure is drawn on a square ruled paper (or grid) by identifying corresponding vertices.

2 Sets

By studying this lesson you will be able to

² identify sets, ² identify the elements of a set, ² write a set by listing the elements that belong to the set, ² write a set in terms of a common property of the elements of the set so that the elements can be clearly identified, and ² represent a set by a Venn diagram.

2.1 Introduction to Sets

The figure shows the types of vegetables that a certain vendor has for sale. The only types of vegetables that the vendor has are carrots, beans, pumpkins and ladies fingers. Accordingly, we can state with certainty whether the vendor has a certain type of vegetable for sale or not.

What has been given above is a collection of several items. Such a collection can be called a group. In our day to day life we have to make decisions on groups, that is, on such collections of items.

Let us consider the following groups.

² The districts that belong to the Southern Province of Sri Lanka² The odd numbers between 1 and 10² The vowels in the English alphabet² The types of birds that are endemic to Sri Lanka, that have been identified by the year 2014² The students who sat the Grade Five Scholarship Examination in 2014

%:× <+−

÷

The items that belong to these groups too can be clearly identified.

A group consisting of such items that can be clearly identified is called a set.

Various types of items can belong to a set. Numbers, physical objects, living beings and symbols too can belong to a set. A set can be expressed by writing down all the items in a certain group or by giving a common property or several common properties by which the items in the group can be clearly identified.

It can be stated with certainty whether a particular item belongs or does not belong to a set which has thus been specified.

The items that belong to a set are defined as its elements.

Accordingly, the district of Galle belongs to the set consisting of the districts of the Southern Province, while neither the district of Gampaha nor the district of Kalutara belongs to this set.

Three more examples of sets are given below.² The set consisting of the even numbers between 1 and 10² The set consisting of the symbols a, d, g, 5, 2 ² The set consisting of the vehicles that were registered in Sri Lanka in 2014

The elements that belong to the above sets can be clearly identified.

Let us now consider the following.

² The tall students in a class² Popular singers of Sri Lanka

The items that belong to such groups cannot be clearly identified since the common properties given above are subjective and debatable.

Therefore a set cannot be identified by considering such properties.

2.2 Writing a set

Let us now learn two methods of writing a set.

²Writing a set by listing the elements of the set within curly brackets

A set can be expressed by writing the elements of the set separated by commas, within curly brackets, when it is possible to list all the elements of the set.

The set consisting of the elements 9, 1, 3 is written as {9, 1, 3}.

h When writing a set in this form, the order in which the elements appear within the curly brackets is not important. Thus, the above set can be written as {1, 3, 9} or {9, 3, 1} or {1, 9, 3} etc.

The set consisting of the elements a, b, d, 9, 1, 3 can be written as {1, 3, 9, a, b, d} or {1, a, 3, b, 9, d} or {a, 1, 3, b, 9, d} etc.

h Capital letters of the English alphabet are usually used to name sets.

Let A be the set of even numbers between 0 and 10. Then it can be written as follows. A = {2, 4, 6, 8}

For free distribution16

%:× <+−

÷

>2x

Let B be the set of letters of the word "integers". Let us express B by writing its elements within curly brackets. B = {i, n, t, e, g, r, s}.

Here the element “e” is written just once.

That is, even if an element appears several times within a group, it is written only once when it is written as an element of a set.

²Writing a set by specifying common properties of its elements by which the elements of the set can be clearly identified

A set can be expressed by writing a common property or common properties of the elements within curly brackets.

The set consisting of the even numbers between 1 and 10 can be written as {Even numbers between 1 and 10}.

The set consisting of the types of birds endemic to Sri Lanka that have been identified by the year 2014 can be written as {Types of birds endemic to Sri Lanka that have been identified by the year 2014}.

Since there are a large number of such types of birds, it is difficult to write this set by listing all the different types within curly brackets.

The set consisting of all odd numbers greater than 0, can be written as{Odd numbers greater than 0}.

Although this set cannot be expressed by writing down all its elements within curly brackets, it can be written as {1, 3, 5, 7, …}

If the elements of a set are in a certain order, when writing the set, the first few elements can be written, and to indicate the remaining elements an ellipsis (three periods) can be used within the curly brackets, after the first few elements.

Accordingly, the set of positive integers can be written as {1, 2, 3, 4, … }.

The set consisting of the types of birds endemic to Sri Lanka that have been identified by 2014 cannot be written in this manner.

Example 1

(i) Write the set A = {Prime numbers between 0 and 15} by writing all the elements that belong to A within curly brackets.(ii) Are 1 and 17 elements of the set A? (i) A = {2" 3" 5" 7" 11" 13}

(ii) Since 1 is not a prime number and 17 is a prime number which is greater than 15, they do not belong to A. Therefore they are not elements of A.

Example 2

B = {The positive integers that are multiples of 3}. Write the elements of B within curly brackets' B = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, ...}

2.3Representing a set by a Venn diagram

Let us write down the elements of the set A = {Even numbers from 1 to 10}' A = {2" 4" 6" 8" 10}'

2 46 8 10ALet us represent this set by a closed figure as shown.

When a set is represented in the above manner by a closed figure, such a figure is defined as a Venn diagram. The elements of the set are written inside the closed figure. Expressing a set in this manner as a closed figure is defined as, representing a set by a Venn diagram.

This method of representing a set by a figure was introduced by the English mathematician John Venn. Therefore such a closed figure is called a Venn diagram.

3 Operations on whole numbers

By studying this lesson you will be able to ² identify the convention used in simplifying numerical expressions, and ² simplify numerical expressions consisting of whole numbers.

3.1 Mathematical operations on two whole numbers

6 + 2 = 8 6 - 2 = 4 6 ÷ 2 = 3 6 × 2 = 12

Addition, multiplication, subtraction and division are symbolized by +, ×, - and ÷ respectively.

You have already learnt how to add and multiply two whole numbers.

Further, you know how to subtract one whole number from another, and how to divide one whole number by another.

Here each mathematical operation was performed only once.

3.2 The order in which mathematical operations in a numerical expression are performed

Consider the expression 3 + 7 × 5. This is a numerical expression with three whole numbers and two operations. Here + and × are defined as the operations of this expression. The order in which the operations appear is + first and then ×.

If we consider the expression 15 ÷ 3 - 2, the order in which the operations appear is ÷ first and then -.

3.3 Simplifying numerical expressions

●Simplifying expressions involving only addition

Let us simplify the expression 8 + 7 + 2 in two different ways.

Let us add 8 and 7 first, and then add 2 to the result. This yields the answer 17.8 + 7 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17

Adding 7 and 2 first, followed by adding 8 to the result also yields the answer 17.8 + 7 + 2 = 8 + 9 = 17

●Simplifying expressions involving only multiplication

Let us simplify the expression 5 × 2 × 3 in two different ways.

Multiplying 5 by 2 first, and then multiplying the result by 3 yields the answer 30. 5 × 2 × 3 = 10 × 3 = 30

Multiplying 2 by 3 first, and then multiplying the result by 5 also yields the answer 30.5 × 2 × 3 = 5 × 6 = 30

(i) 12 + 5 + 8 (ii) 5 × 8 × 3 (iii) 7 + 3 + 2 + 6 (iv) 2 × 5 × 4 × 3

3.4 Further simplification of numerical expressions

10 + 2 × 3 = 10 + 6 = 1610 + 2 × 3 = 12 × 3 = 36Let us simplify the expression 10 + 2 × 3. Let us compare the answers we obtain when we simplify 10 + 2 × 3 by performing the operations in two different orders.

Let us first add 10 to 2 and then multiply the answer by 3.10 + 2 × 3 = 12 × 3 = 36.

Now let us multiply 2 by 3, and then add 10 to it. 10 + 2 × 3 = 10 + 6 = 16Therefore, it is clear that when numbers simplify such numerical expressions which involve more than two terms and several operations, we may end up with different answers, depending on the order in which we perform the operations. This emphasises the need for a convention when simplifying expressions involving two or more operations.Let us consider below the convention used when simplifying such expressions.

$ First perform all divisions (÷) and multiplications (×), working from left to right.

$ Then perform all additions (+) and subtractions (-), working from left to right.

Only the operations of addition and multiplication appear in the expression 10 + 2 × 3 . According to the above convention, multiplication should be performed first.10 + 2 × 3 = 10 + 6 = 16

Also, if only subtraction (-) and addition (+), or only division (÷) and multiplication (×) appear in a numerical expression, simplification is done from left to right in the order that the operations appear.

h Simplifying expressions involving only addition and subtraction

Let us simplify the expression 10 - 7 + 2'Here the order in which the operations appear from left to right is – first and then +.When simplifying 10 - 7 + 2, first 7 is subtracted from 10 and then 2 is added to the result.

∴ 10 - 7 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5

Another example is: 6 + 7 - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11

h Simplifying expressions involving only multiplication and division

Let us deal with the expression 36 ÷ 6 × 3 in a similar way. Here the order in which the operations appear from left to right is ÷ first and then ×.

Let us first divide 36 by 6, and then multiply the answer by 3. We then obtain 36 ÷ 6 × 3 = 6 × 3 = 18

Another example is: 36 × 6 ÷ 3 = 216 ÷ 3 = 72

²Simplifying expressions with brackets

If we want to subtract 2 from 3 first, and then subtract the result from 10, we write it as 10 - (3 - 2), with 3 - 2 within brackets. This emphasises that the operation within brackets has to be done first.

That is, 10 - (3 - 2) = 10 - 1 = 9.

Consider the following example.A practical examination in music is held over six days. Each day, twelve candidates participate in the morning session, while 8 participate in the afternoon session. Let us find the total number of candidates.

Number of candidates in each morning session = 12 Number of candidates in each afternoon session = 8 Total number of candidates during the six days = (12 + 8) × 6 = 20 × 6 = 120

Observe that the usage of brackets has been necessary in deriving the correct answer. The convention followed when simplifying expressions involving whole numbers and the operations +" -" ×" ÷" and brackets is as follows.

4 Factors and Multiples (Part I)

By studying this lesson, you will be able to ²examine whether a whole number is divisible by 3, 4, 6 or 9.

4'1 Examining whether a number is divisible by 3, 4, 6 or 9

It is important to know the divisibility rules when solving problems related to factors and multiples.

If a certain whole number can be divided by another whole number without remainder, then the first number is said to be divisible by the second number. We then identify the second number as a factor of the first number.

6 ÷ 2 = 3 with remainder 0. Therefore, 2 is a factor of 6.

6 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 2. Therefore, 4 is not a factor of 6.

One way to find factors of numbers quickly is to use tests of divisibility.

The divisibility rules you learnt in grade 6 are as follows.

²If the ones place digit of a number is divisible by 2, then that number is divisible by 2. ²If the ones place digit of a number is either 0 or 5, then that number is divisible by 5. ²If the ones place digit of a number is 0, then that number is divisible by 10.

² The digital root

Now let us learn about the digital root of a number.

The digital root of a number is calculated by adding up all the digits of that number (and adding the digits of the sums if necessary), until a single digit from 1 to 9 is left. That single digit is defined as the digital root of the relevant number.

Let us find the digital root of 68.6 + 8 = 14. Let us add the digits of 14. 1 + 4 = 5. / The digital root of 68 is 5.

It is possible to identify certain properties of a number by considering its digital root.

4.2 Factors and multiples of a whole number

You learnt in grade six, how to find the factors and multiples of a whole number. Let us recall what you learnt.Let us find the factors of 36.

Let us factorize 36 by expressing it as a product of two whole numbers. 36 = 1 × 36 36 = 2 × 18 When a whole number is written as a product of two whole numbers, those two numbers are known as factors of the original number.36 = 3 × 1236 = 4 × 936 = 6 × 6Therefore, the factors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 36.

Let us factorize 126, using the method of division.

126632

Since the number 126, can be divided by 2 without remainder, 2 is a factor of 126.Since, 2 × 63 = 126, we obtain that 63 is also a factor of 126.

126216126187126149126914

2 × 63 = 126 3 × 42 = 126 6 × 21 = 126 7 × 18 = 126 9 × 14 = 126 14 × 9 = 126

Therefore, the factors of 126 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 14, 18, 21, 42, 63 and 126.

2 × 633 × 426 × 217 × 189 × 1414 × 9Note:The divisibility rules can be used to determine whether a given number is divisible by another number or not.

Now let us consider how multiples of a whole number are found.

Let us compute the multiples of 13. This can be done by multiplying 13 by whole numbers.

13 × 1 = 13 13 × 2 = 26 13 × 3 = 39 13 × 4 = 52

13, 26, 39 and 52 are a few examples of multiples of 13. Note that 13 is a factor of each of them. Therefore, any number of which 13 is a factor, is a multiple of 13.

4.3 Prime factors of a whole number

You have already learnt that whole numbers greater than one with exactly two distinct factors are called prime numbers.

There are only two prime numbers among them, namely, 2 and 3. These are the prime factors of 36.

Let us find the prime factors of 60. The factors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 15, 20, 30 and 60. The prime factors among them are 2, 3 and 5.

The prime numbers among the factors of a number are its prime factors.

Any whole number which is not a prime number can be expressed as a product of its prime factors.

A method of finding the prime factors of a whole number using the method of division and writing the number as a product of its prime factors is described below.

Let us find the prime factors of 84 and write it as a product of its prime factors.

$ Here 84 has been divided by 2, the smallest prime number.

$ Division by 2 is continued, until a number which is not divisible by 2 is obtained. $ When this result is divided by the next smallest prime, which is 3, the result 7 is obtained. When this is divided by the prime number 7, the answer obtained is 1.

$ In this manner, we continue dividing by prime numbers until the answer 1 is obtained.

Accordingly, the prime factors of 84 are 2, 3 and 7, which are the numbers by which 84 was divided.

Now, to write 84 as a product of its prime factors, write it as a product of the prime numbers by which it was divided.84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7

Let us write 75 as a product of its prime factors. Let us divide 75 by prime numbers.

$ Since 75 is not divisible by 2, we divide it by 3, the next smallest prime number.

$ The result 25 is not divisible by 3.

$ When 25 is divided twice by 5 which is the next smallest prime number, the result is 1.

Accordingly, when 75 is written as a product of its prime factors we obtain 75 = 3 × 5 × 5.

² When finding the prime factors of a whole number, the number is divided by the prime numbers which divide it without remainder, starting from the smallest such prime number, until the answer 1 is obtained.

² The prime numbers which divide a number without remainder are its prime factors.

² To write a number as a product of its prime factors, write it as a product of the prime numbers by which it was divided.

Since 63 is not divisible by 2, division is started with 3. The result 21 is again divided by 3. Then we obtain 7 which is not divisible by 3. We divide this by 7 to obtain 1.

Therefore, 63 written as a product of its prime factors is63 = 3 × 3 × 7'

72 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3

72 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 2 × 36

4.5 Highest Common Factor (HCF) (Greatest Common Divisor (GCD))

Let us now consider what the highest common factor (HCF) of several numbers is and how it is found.

Let us find the highest common factor of the numbers 6, 12 and 18.

$ Write down the factors of these numbers as follows.

Factors of 6: 1, 2, 3 and 6Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 18

$ Circle and write the factors common to all three numbers.

The factors which are common to 6, 12 and 18 are, 1, 2, 3 and 6. $ The largest number among the common factors is the highest common factor of these numbers.

We observe that the largest or the greatest of these common factors is 6. Therefore, 6 is the highest common factor of 6, 12 and 18.

Thus, the highest common factor of 6, 12 and 18 is 6, which is the largest number by which these three numbers are divisible.

² Given two or more numbers, the largest number which is a factor of all of them is known as their highest common factor (HCF). ² Accordingly, the highest common factor is the largest number by which all the given numbers are divisible. ² If 1 is the only common divisor of several numbers, then the highest common factor of these numbers is 1.

$ The highest common factor is obtained by taking the product of the prime factors which are common to all three numbers.

2 and 3 are the common prime factors of 6, 12 and 18. Thus, the HCF of 6, 12 and 18 is 2 × 3 = 6.

² Finding the highest common factor by the method of division

Let us find the highest common factor of 6, 12 and 18.

$ Write the numbers as shown. 2 6" 12" 183 3" 6" 9

1" 2" 3

$ Since all these numbers are divisible by 2, divide each of them by 2 individually. $ The result is 3, 6 and 9. Since 3, 6 and 9 are divisible by 3, the next smallest prime number, divide them by 3 and write the result below the respective numbers. $ The result is 1, 2 and 3. Since there isn’t a prime number which divides all of 1, 2 and 3 without remainder, the division is stopped here. $ The HCF is obtained by multiplying the numbers by which division was done.Thus the HCF of 6, 12 and 18 is 2 × 3 = 6.

When using the method of division to find the HCF,

$ keep dividing all the numbers by the prime numbers which divide all the numbers without remainder. $ then multiply all the divisors and obtain the HCF of the given numbers.

When the factors common to both these numbers are selected we obtain 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 36.

Since the greatest of these common factors is 36, the highest common factor of 72 and 108 is 36.

The prime factors which are common to both the numbers 72 and 108 are 2, 2, 3 and 3.

Accordingly, the HCF of 72 and 108š = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 36

Write down the quantity of each item in a single parcel. ª Every parcel should contain the same number of items of a particular type. To find the maximum number of parcels that can be made, we need to find the largest number which divides 30, 24 and 18 without remainder. Therefore, let us find the HCF of 30, 24 and 18.

30 = 2 × 3 × 524 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 18 = 2 × 3 × 3 HCF of 30, 24 and 18 = 2 × 3 = 6.The maximum number of parcels that can be made = 6 The number of cakes of soap in a parcel = 30 ÷ 6 = 5 The number of tubes of toothpaste in a parcel = 24 ÷ 6 = 4 The number of bottles of ointment in a parcel = 18 ÷ 6 = 3

$ Circle and write down the common multiples.You will observe that the common multiples of the three numbers listed here are 12 and 24.

Further, if we continue to write the common multiples of 2, 3 and 4, we will obtain 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 etc

$ The smallest of the common multiples of several numbers is called the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.

The smallest or the least of the common multiples 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, … of the numbers 2, 3 and 4 is 12. Therefore, 12 is the least common multiple of 2, 3 and 4.

In other words, the smallest number which is divisible by 2, 3 and 4 is the least common multiple of 2, 3 and 4.

The least common multiple of several numbers is the smallest positive number which is divisible by all these numbers.

²The HCF of several numbers is equal to or smaller than the smallest of these numbers ²The LCM of several numbers is equal to or larger than the largest of these numbers. ²The HCF of any two numbers is smaller than the LCM of the two numbers.

$ Let us select the greatest power of each prime factor. There are two distinct prime factors, namely, 2 and 3. When the factors of all three numbers are considered,the power of 2 with the largest index = 22the power of 3 with the largest index = 32.

$ The LCM of the given numbers is the product of these greatest powers. Therefore, the LCM of 4, 12 and 18 = 22 × 32

5.3 Finding the value of a power by substitution

Let us consider expressions in index notation with bases which are unknowns. By substituting values for the unknown bases, the value of an expression in index notation can be found. In this lesson, only positive integers are substituted.

Let us find the value of the expression x3 when x = 2.

Method IIx3 = x × x × x By substituting the value 2 for x we obtain, x3 = 2 × 2 × 2 x3 = 8

Method IBy substituting the value 2 for x we obtain,x3 = 23 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8

Example 1

Find the value of each of the following expressions when x = 5. (i) x3

Method I x3 = 53 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125

Method II x3 = x × x × x = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125

(ii) 3x 3x = 3 × x

= 3 × 5

= 15

6 Time

By studying this lesson you will be able to ² identify months, years, decades, centuries and millenniums as units of time ² identify a leap year, ² identify the relationships between units of time, and ² add and subtract units of time.

6.1 Units of time

You have already learnt that the units seconds, minutes , hours and days are used to measure time.

You have also learnt to find the time it takes to do different daily activities.

Now, let us learn more on the units of measuring time - months, years, decades, centuries and millenniums.

●Months and years

If we want to calculate the time taken for an event which commences on a particular date and ends on another date, in terms of days, weeks or months, we can do so by looking at a calendar.

A calendar is made up of the units days, weeks and months. You will see that there are 12 months in a calendar.

The calendar of year 2015 is shown below. The table shows the number of days in each month.

2015

The calendar of a particular year provides information on a period of a year, starting from the first of January and ending on the thirty first of December of that year.

According to the year 2015 calendar, the total number of days in the year is 365. There are 365 days in a year which is not a leap year. We will be studying about leap years later.

) The day 2015-08-01 means, the time period from 00:00 on 2015-08-01 to 24:00 on 2015-08-01.

) The time at which a particular day ends ,is the time at which the next day starts. So the time 24:00 on 2015-08-01 is the same as the time 00:00 on 2015-08-02.

) The year 2015 means, the time period from 00:00 on 2015-01-01 to 24:00 on 2015-12-31.

Note ( The international convention for measuring years is by considering the year of the birth of Jesus.

BC and AD are commonly used to count years in time. Jesus Christ’s birth is used as the starting point to count years that existed before (BC) and after (AD) he was born.

●Decades

A time period of ten years is considered as a decade. Let us consider 1948.

The first year in the decade that contains the year 1948 is 1941, and the last year in that decade is 1950.

The time period from AD 1 to AD 10 is called the first decade.The time period from AD 11 to AD 20 is called the second decade.The time period from AD 1811 to AD 1820 is called the hundred and eighty second decade.The time period from AD 1951 to AD 1960 is called the hundred and ninety sixth decade.The time period from AD 2011 to AD 2020 is called the two hundred and second decade.

That is, the time period from time 00:00 on 1941-01-01 to time 24:00 on 1950-12-31 is a decade. This decade is identified as the 195th decade.

●Centuries

A time period of a hundred years is called a century.

AD 1 to AD 100 is the first century.AD 101 to AD 0200 is the second century.AD 1801 to AD 1900 is the nineteenth century.AD 1901 to AD 2000 is the twentieth century.AD 2001 to AD 2100 is the twenty first century.

The time period from 00:00 on 2001-01-01 to 24:00 on 2100-12-31 is the twenty first century.

●A Millennium

A time period of a 1000 years is known as a millennium. According to the calendar, at this moment we are living in the third millennium.

The time period from AD 1 to 1000 is the first millennium.The time period from AD 1001 to 2000 is the second millennium.

The calendar of 2016 is given below. Consider the number of days in each month . How does this differ from the calendar of 2015 ?

The months having 31 days

The months having 30 days

The months having 29 days January AprilFebruaryMarch June May September July November AugustOctober December

Any year in which there are 29 days in the month of February has 366 days in total. Such a year is defined as a leap year.

If a number that denotes a year is divisible by 4 but is not a multiple of 100, then that year is a leap year. However years which are denoted by numbers that are multiples of 100 become leap years only if they divisible by 400.

∴ Example 1Is the year 2000 a leap year?

Since 2000 = 100 × 20, 2000 is a multiple of 100.Since 2000 ÷ 400 = 5, 2000 is divisible by 400. So year 2000 is a leap year.

Example 2

Is the year 1900 a leap year?1900 is a multiple of 100.1900 is not divisible by 400.∴ 1900 is not a leap year.

Example 3

Is the year 2008 a leap year?2008 is not a multiple of 100.2008 ÷ 4 = 502, 2008 is divisible by four .∴2008 is a leap year.

Example 4

Is 2010 a leap year?2010 is not a multiple of 100.

The number that is formed by the last two digits of 2010, that is 10, is not divisible by 4. Therefore by the rules of divisibility, 2010 is also not divisible by 4. Hence, 2010 is not a multiple of 4. Therefore 2010 is not a leap year.

Note ( Any year which is not a multiple of 4 is not a leap year.

●Further units of time

60 seconds = 1 minute60 minutes = 1 hour24 hours = 1 dayThere are months consisting of 28 days, 29 days, 30 days and 31 days.

However a time period of 30 days is considered as a month.12 months = 1 year365 days = 1 year366 days = 1 leap yearA time period given in years can be represented in days, by multiplying it by 365.A time period given in years can be represented in months, by multiplying it by 12. Note ( We consider 30 days as a month. However, because a year consists of 12 months, you should not think that the number of days in a year is 360 (12 × 30 days). A year consists of 365 days.

Example 1

(i) Indicate 280 days in months and days.

9 30 280 270 10 Therefore, 280 days is 9 months and 10 days.

(i) Indicate 3 years in months. (ii) Indicate 3 years in days. ª (i) 3 years = 3 × 12 months = 36 months(ii) 3 years = 3 × 365 days = 1095 days

Example 1A teacher served for 5 years 6 months and 23 days in a school in the Eastern province and for 6 years 8 months and 15 days in a school in the Central province. He served the rest of his career in a school in the Southern province.

(i) Find in total how long he served in the Eastern and Central provinces.(ii) If he served for 28 years, 2 months and 2 days in total, then find how long he served in the school in the Southern province.

(i) Years Months Days 5 6 23 6 8 15 8+

Let us add the days in the “days column”23 days + 15 days = 38 days38 days = 1 month + 8 daysLet us write the 8 days in the “days column”. Let us carry the 1 month to the “months column”.

Years Months Days 5 6 23 6 8 15 12 3 8+

1 month + 6 months + 8 months = 15 months = 1 year and 3 monthsLet us write the 3 months in the “months column”.Let us carry the year to the “years column”.

1 year + 5 years + 6 years =12 years.

The total service of the teacher in the Eastern and Central provinces is 12 years, 3 months and 8 days.

(ii) Years Months Days 28 2 2 12 3 8 24-

Let us subtract the days in the “days column”.Since 2<8 let us take a period of one month, that is 30 days from the “months column” and add it to the “days column”. Then, 30 days + 2 days = 32 days.32 days - 8 days = 24 days.Let us write the 24 days in the “days column”.

Years Months Days 28 2 2 12 3 8 15 10 24-

Now, in the months column we have to subtract 3 months from the remaining 1month. Since this cannot be done, let us carry a period of 1 year, that is 12 months, from the “years column” to the “months column”. Then,12 months + 1 month = 13 months13 months – 3 months = 10 monthsLet us write the 10 months in the “ months column”.

●Why Do We Have Leap Years?

Sun

The earth on the 1st of January

The earth 365 days later.

In any year which is not a leap year there are 365 days.A year is defined as the time it takes for the Earth to orbit around the sun once.However, the exact time it takes for the earth to orbit around the sun is 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes and 46 seconds. This is about 365 40097 days' So when we say a year has 365 days, we have neglected a time period of 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds (which is little less than 1/4 day). Four of these periods added together is approximately one day. We add this as an extra day to the calendar once every four years. It is added to the month of February. This is how we get a leap year.

A leap year has an extra day. Due to the decision to add an extra day to the calendar once every four years, 3 additional days get included in each 400 year period.

Although an extra day is added once every four years, only 23 hours 15 minutes and 4 seconds should actually be added once every four years. Therefore, due to the decision of adding an extra day once every four years, there are approximately 3 additional days that are included in each period of 400 years.

Therefore three days need to be removed from every 400 year period.

To do this, an extra day is not added to the month of February for the first three century years. (A century year is a year ending in 00 )

Non-century years are leap years if they are multiples of four.

8 Directed Numbers

By studying this lesson you will be able to ²² identify what directed numbers are,²² add integers using the number line, and²² add directed numbers without using the number line.

8.1 Identifying directed numbers

The figure given here represents an indicator that is used to measure the water level of a reservoir from which water is distributed to a certain city.

The usual water level of the reservoir has been marked as 0 (zero), and the indicator has been calibrated such that the gaps between the numbers above the 0 limit and below the 0 limit are equal.

Thereby it can be observed whether the water level of the reservoir is above or below 0 (the usual level). Here, by calibrating the indicator in opposite directions, a correct perception of the water level of the reservoir is obtained.

Similarly, thermometers that are used to measure the temperature of the environment are calibrated in opposite directions from 0o C, to indicate temperatures that are greater than 0o C and temperatures that are less than 0o C.

The thermometer in the figure has been calibrated with the values 10, 20, 30, … in one direction to indicate the temperatures that are greater than 0o C, and with the values -10, -20, -30, … in the opposite direction to indicate the temperatures that are less than 0o C.

Let us now consider the number line given below.

- 3 - 2 - 1 0 1 2 3 4

The positive whole numbers marked to the right of the position indicating zero on the number line are defined as positive integers and the negative whole numbers marked to the left of the position indicating zero are defined as negative whole numbers.

{…, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …} is the set consisting of all the integers.

Any positive number can be marked on the above number line to the right of the position indicating and any negative number can be marked to the left of the position indicating 0, taking into consideration the magnitude of the number.

All the numbers that are written with a positive or negative sign to indicate not only their magnitude but also one of two directions which are opposite to each other are defined as directed numbers.

Accordingly, numbers such as + 4" + 43 " + 5'7" - 10, - 31 and - 3'2are directed numbers. + 4 is read as positive four and - 31 is read as negative one third.

²When a sign is not written in front of a number, it is considered as a positive number.

Let us consider the examples related to adding two positive integers that were studied in the previous section.

Using the number line we obtained previously that,

^+2& + ^+1& = ^+3& and ^+3& + ^+2& = ^+5&'

^+2& + ^+1& = ^+3& 2 + 1 = 3^+3& + ^+2& = ^+5& 3 + 2 = 5

$ When adding two positive integers, add the two numbers without considering the signs. $ Place the positive sign in the final answer.

Let us now reconsider the examples related to adding two negative integers that were studied in the previous section.

Using the number line we obtained previously that

^-2& + ^-1& = ^-3& and ^-3& + ^-2& = ^-5&' Let us consider ^-2& + ^-1& = ^-3&

$ Without considering the signs of the two directed numbers, obtain their sum. 2 + 1 = 3 $ Then write the answer with the negative sign. Therefore the answer is -3.

If we observe our surroundings, we can identify many angles. A few examples are given below.

Angle between the edges of a cover of a book Angle between two partsof the roof.

Angles between the adjacent spokes of a wheel

Mathematics

A common property of the above angles is that their magnitude does not change.

² If the magnitude of an angle does not change, then it is static in nature.

² So the angles in the above figures are static in nature.

² Note that the magnitude of the angle between two spokes of a wheel does not change, even when the wheel is turning.

Let us now consider some situations that involve rotation.

The angle between the two blades of a pair of scissors changes when it is used for cutting.

The angle between the top edge of a door and a door frame changes when the door is being opened or closed.

The angle between the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock changes in magnitude with time. The figure shows this angle at 4 p.m. and 4.15 p.m.

In the examples given above, let us consider the arms of the angle involved.

We see that there is a rotation of both arms or of one of them. Therefore, the magnitude of the angle changes. This is the dynamic nature of such an angle.

Let us understand the dynamic nature of an angle further by doing the following activity.

Step 1 - Take a fresh green ekel and bend it into two parts at the centre, taking care not to break it. Step 2 - Overlap the two parts of the ekel and place it on a table. Hold one part tightly on the table. Step 3 - In your exercise book, draw several situations that are obtained by rotating the other part on the table. A few such situations that can be obtained are shown below.

Figure I

² In Figure I, two angles have been created by the straight line segments AB and BC meeting.

² The straight line segments AB and BC are defined as the “arms of the angle”. The point B where AB and BC meet is defined as the “vertex of the angle”.

² The magnitude of the angle which is indicated in red is less than that of a straight angle; that is, less than the magnitude of two right angles.

² The magnitude of the angle indicated in blue is greater than that of a straight angle.

² The angle indicated in red is named as angle ABC and is written as " ABCor CBA

² Here we write the letter which indicates the vertex in the middle and the other two letters beside it.

² The angle indicated in blue is named as the reflex angle ABC and is written as reflex angle ABC or reflex angle CBA.

² In some books angle ABC is written as .

Example 1

Draw the angles with the straight line segments PQ and PR as their arms. Name the two angles. Q

9.4 Measuring angles

There are standard units and instruments to measure distance, mass, time and the volume of a liquid. You learnt about these in grade 6.Now let us learn about a standard unit and an instrument used to measure angles.

The standard unit used to measure angles is degrees. One degree is written as 1o.

360o

The angle that is formed when a straight line segment completes one full circle by rotating about a point is 360o'

The instrument used to measure angles is made of one half of a full circle. It is called a “protractor”. The figure of a protractor is shown below. It is numbered from 0o to 180o clockwise and anticlockwise. The line indicated by 0 - 0 is called the “base line”.

There are two scales indicated in the protractor. They are the inner scale and the outer scale.

Place the protractor on the figure such that the origin and the base line coincide with the vertex O and the arm OA respectively.

Then the arm OB coincides with the line indicated by 50o in the inner scale (Note that OA coincides with 0o on this scale). Therefore the magnitude of the angle AOB is 50o, and we write AOB= 50o.

By observing this figure, we see that an angle of 1o is a small angle which is difficult to draw.

10 Fractions

(Part I)

By studying this lesson you will be able to ²identify mixed numbers and improper fractions, and ²convert a mixed number into an improper fraction and an improper fraction into a mixed number.

10.1 Fractions

Let us take the area bounded by the figure given below as one unit.

This unit has been divided into five equal parts, of which two have been coloured. As we have learnt previously, the amount coloured is 2 5 .

Similarly, if we take the four buttons shown below as one unit, we known that an amount of 3 buttons is 3 4 of the amount of buttons there are.

Of the 25 children in a class, 13 are girls. When the number of girls in the class is written as a fraction of the total number of children in the class we obtain 1325. Here the total number of children in the class, that is 25, has been taken as one unit.

When a fraction is written numerically in this manner, the number below the line is called the denominator and the number above the line is called the numerator.

Numbers such as 23 , 34 and 25 which are smaller than one but larger than zero are called proper fractions. In a proper fraction, the numerator is always smaller than the denominator.Proper fractions such as 12 " 13 and 14 , with the numerator equal to 1, are defined as unit fractions.

Any fraction can be written in terms of its corresponding unit fraction.

For example, is two 1 3 s. 23

517 is five 1 17 s'

Next let us recall what we have learnt about equivalent fractions.

36

Let us consider these three figures. The amounts that have been coloured in these figures are equal. That is, the fractions 1 2 , 2 4and 36 that are represented by these figures

are equal to each other.

That is, 1 2 = 2 4 = 36 .

We learnt in grade 6 that such fractions, which have denominators which are different to each other and numerators too which are different to each other, but which represent the same number are defined as equivalent fractions.

A fraction equivalent to a given fraction can be obtained by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of the given fraction by a whole number (other than 0). Two such examples are given below.

A fraction equivalent to a given fraction can also be obtained by dividing both the numerator and the denominator of the given fraction by a whole number (other than 0) which divides the numerator and the denominator without remainder.

Let us find a fraction equivalent to 1824. Let us divide the numerator and the denominator of 1824 by 3 which divides 18 and 24 without remainder.

1824 = = 6824 ÷ 318 ÷ 3

10.2 Mixed numbers and improper fractions

1 1 2A whole cake and exactly half of an identical cake are shown in the figure. When the whole cake is taken as a unit, it is expressed as 1 and the other part which is exactly half of such a cake, is expressed as 12 . Therefore, the total amount of cake in the figure is 1 21 + times the whole cake. This is written as 1 21, and read as one and a half. When a number which is the sum of a whole number and a proper fraction is written in this manner, it is defined as a mixed number. The whole number in the mixed number is called the whole number part and the proper fraction in it is called the fractional part.

Let us write the mixed numbers represented in the following figures in

Here, each child receives one whole fruit and half of another fruit.

That is, the total amount that each child receives = 1 21+fruits. This is written as 121.

Next, let us consider another way of dividing these three guavas equally between the two children.

3 halves = ' 1 1 1 3 2 2 2 2+ + = 3 halves = ' 1 1 1 3 2 2 2 2+ + = (Divide each fruit into two equal parts )

Accordingly, each child gets 3 halves, which is an amount of 3

2 guavas.

In both the above cases, each child receives the same amount of guava. Therefore, 3

2 = 1 12 .

The numerator of 3

2 is greater than the denominator.

If the numerator of a fraction is greater or equal to the denominator, it is defined as an improper fraction.

We observed above that when three guavas are divided equally between two children, each child receives an amount of 32 guavas. Therefore, 32 represents the same value that is obtained when 3 ÷ 2. That is, any proper fraction or improper fraction represents the number that is obtained when its numerator is divided by its denominator.

10.5 Comparison of fractions ² Comparison of fractions having the same numerator

You have learnt that when two fractions with equal numerators are considered, the fraction with the smaller denominator is greater than the other fraction.

Accordingly, 45 is greater than 47 . That is, 45 > 47 '

Further, when 57 " 59 " 58 are arranged in ascending order we obtain

59 " 58 " 57 ' That is, 59 < 58 < 57 '

² Comparison of fractions having the same denominator

You have also learnt that when two fractions with equal denominators are considered, the fraction with the larger numerator is greater than the other fraction.Accordingly, 35 is greater than 25 ' That is, 25 < 35 '

Further, when 911 " 211 " 1511 are arranged in ascending order we obtain

² Further comparison of fractions

Now let us consider how the greater fraction is identified when two fractions with unequal numerators and unequal denominators are compared by writing equivalent fractions having a common denominator.Let us compare the fractions 53 and 76 '

Let us find the fraction with denominator 6 that is equivalent to 53 'To do this, let us multiply the numerator and denominator of 53 by 2.53 = 5 × 23 × 2 = 106

106 > 76 '

Since106 = 53 we obtain 53 > 76 '

Therefore, of the two fractions 53 and 76 , the larger fraction is 53 '

Let us compare the fraction 712 and 58 '

Neither denominator of the fractions 712 and 58 can be written as a multiple of the other. In such situations, the fractions have to be converted into equivalent fractions that have a denominator which is a multiple of the denominators of both fractions. It is convenient to take the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 8 in this situation.

95 = 9 × 125 × 12 = 10860

Therefore, the least common multiple of 12 and 5 = 12 × 5 = 60'

Since 10860 > 8560 we obtain, 95 > 1712'

A proper fraction is always smaller than an improper fraction with the same denominator.

10.6 Comparison of mixed numbers

² Mixed numbers with unequal whole number parts

Let us find the larger number from the mixed numbers 121 and 2 53. $ First, let us examine the whole number parts of the two mixed numbers.

$ If the whole number parts are unequal, then the mixed number with the greater whole number part is the larger mixed number.

Accordingly, when the whole number parts of 121 and 253 are considered, they are 1 and 3 respectively. Since 3 > 1, the larger mixed number is 253.

253 > 121'

² Mixed numbers with equal whole number parts

$ The whole number parts of the above two numbers are equal.

$ Therefore, let us compare the fractional parts of these mixed numbers.

Accordingly, let us compare the fractional parts 25 and 12 of the mixed

numbers 253 and 1 23.

25 = 2 × 25 × 2 = 410

12 = 1 × 52 × 5 = 510

Since 510 > 410" we obtain 12 > 25 '

Therefore, 1 23 > 2 53'

Method II

$ Express the mixed numbers as improper fractions.

$ The larger mixed number can be selected by considering which equivalent improper fraction is larger.217553= 17223=

Now let us write 175 and 72 as fractions with equal denominators.

175 = 17 × 25 × 2 = 3410

72 = 7 × 52 × 5 = 3510

Since 3510 > 3410 " we obtain 72 > 175 '

By studying this lesson you will be able to ² add and subtract fractions.

10.7 Addition of fractions

² Addition of fractions having the same denominator

In Grade 6 you learnt to add proper fractions with equal denominators as well as proper fractions with unequal denominators.

Let us consider the addition of fractions with equal denominators.

2112 + 9988 88+==

When fractions with equal denominators are added, the denominator of the answer is the same as the denominators of the fractions that are added. The numerator of the answer is the sum of the numerators of the fractions that are added.

The above answer 118 can also be expressed as a mixed number. Then

the answer is 38 1 .

² Addition of fractions with unequal denominators

When fractions with unequal denominators are being added, the given fractions need to be first converted into equivalent fractions with equal denominators, and then added.

Here, it is convenient to convert the given fractions into equivalent fractions that have the least common multiple of the denominators of the given fractions as the denominator.

11.1 Writing a proper fraction with a denominator which is a power of ten, as a decimal number

In Grade 6 we learnt how to write a proper fraction with 10 or 100 as the denominator, as a decimal number.

When a unit is divided into 10 equal parts, then one

part is equal to 110 '

This is denoted as a decimal number, by 0.1.

That is, 0.1 = 110 .

When a unit is divided into 100 equal parts, then one part is equal to 1100.This is denoted as a decimal number, by 0.01.That is, 0.01 = 1100.

We have learnt that when a unit is divided into 1000 equal parts, then one part is equal to 11000 '11000 is written in decimal form as 0.001. That is, 0.001 = 11000 .

The number 0.001 is read as zero point zero zero one. The position where 1 is written after the second decimal place in 0.001 is defined as the third decimal place. The place value of the third decimal place is 10001 .

Let us consider 100024 '

100024 = 100020 + 10004

Since, 100020 = 1000 ÷ 1020 ÷ 10 = 1002

100024 = two 1001 s + four 10001 s'

Accordingly, 100024 = 0'024'

11.2 Writing a proper fraction with a denominator which is not a power of ten, as a decimal number

Let us learn how to express a proper fraction with a denominator which is not a power of 10, as a decimal number.

$ The given fraction can easily be written as a decimal number if it can be converted into an equivalent fraction which has a power of 10 as its denominator.

Let us express 12 as a decimal number.

10 can be divided by 2 without remainder. 10 ÷ 2 = 5. Therefore, by multiplying the numerator and the denominator of 12 by 5, it can be converted into an equivalent fraction with 10 as the denominator. 12 = 12

× 5× 5 = 510

510 = 0'5

Therefore, 12 = 0'5.

Let us express 14 as a decimal number.

Although 10 cannot be divided by 4 without remainder, 100 can be divided by 4 without remainder. 100 ÷ 4 = 25. Therefore, by multiplying the numerator and the denominator of 14by 25, it can be converted into an equivalent fraction with 100 as the denominator.

25100

= 2510014

× 25× 25=14

= 0'25

Therefore, 14 = 0'25.Let us express 18 as a decimal number.

Although 10 and 100 cannot be divided by 8 without remainder, 1000 can be divided by 8 without remainder. 1000 ÷ 8 = 125.

Therefore, by multiplying the numerator and the denominator of 18 by

125, it can be converted into an equivalent fraction with 1000 as the

denominator. 18 = 1 × 1258 × 125 = 1251000

1251000 = 0.125

Therefore, 18 = 0.125.

According to the above description, the proper fractions that can be converted into equivalent fractions with a power of 10 as the denominator, can easily be expressed as decimal numbers.

That is, if 10, 100, 1000 or any other power of 10 can be divided without remainder by the denominator of a given fraction, then that fraction can be written as a decimal number with one or more decimal places.

Example 1 Express each of the fractions 15 " 1325 and 77125 as a decimal number.

15 = 210 = 0'2 1325 = 52100 = 0'52

77125 = 77 × 8125 × 8 = 6161000 = 0'616

Let us write 175 as a decimal number.

Method II175 = 3410 = 3010 + 410

Example 1

Express 98 as a decimal number. Method I98 = 1 + 18

Let us write 0.375 as a fraction.

There fore, 0.375 = 1000375

To express 1000375 in its simplest form, let us divide the numerator and the

11.6 Multiplying a decimal number by a whole number

2 × 3 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 This illustrates the fact that the product of two whole numbers can be obtained by writing it as a sum.

Now let us find the value of 0.1 × 3.0'1 × 3 = 0'1 + 0'1 + 0'1 = 0'3

Let us find the value of 0.8 × 2.0'8 × 2 = 0'8 + 0'8= 1'6

Let us find the value of 0.35 × 4.0'35 × 4 = 0'35 + 0'35 + 0'35 + 0'35 = 1'40= 1'4 Let us examine the above answers by considering the following table.

0'1 × 3 = 0'3 0'8 × 2 = 1'60'35 × 4 = 1'40

1 × 3 = 3

8 × 2 = 1635 × 4 = 140

12.1 Constructing algebraic expressions

Kavin buys the same amount of milk every day. If this amount is not known, then we cannot represent it by a number although it is a constant value.

As in the above situation, when the numerical value of a constant amount is not known, it is defined as an “unknown constant”.

The daily income of a certain shop takes different values depending on its daily sales. Since the daily income is not a fixed value, it is a variable.

Simple letters of the English alphabet such as a,b,c,…,x,y,z are used to represent unknown constants and variables.

Accordingly, considering the above two examples, the amount of milk bought each day can be denoted by the letter a and the daily income of the shop can be denoted by x.

Let us denote the number of bananas in a bunch in a shop by a. When a comb of 12 bananas is sold, the number of bananas remaining in the bunch can be denoted by a - 12.

12.4 Simplifying the terms of an algebraic expression

Let us consider an algebraic expression similar to one we constructed earlier.

NimalDeepaniThe price of an orange is a rupees. Nimal bought 5 oranges and Deepani bought 8.

Nimal spent 5a rupees and Deepani spent 8a rupees. So the total amount of money spent by both of them is 5a + 8a.

Since the number of oranges bought by both of them is 13, the total amount spent is 13 × a rupees. That is 13a rupees.This shows that 5a + 8a = 13a'

Algebraic terms such as 5a and 8a which have the same unknown are called “like terms”. By adding or subtracting several such terms, we can simplify them to one term.

There are no like terms in the algebraic expression 4x + 3y + 5. Such an expression cannot be simplified further. The terms 4x, 3y, 5 of this expression are called “unlike terms”.

Let us simplify 4x + 3y + x + 2y.Let us write the like terms together. 4x + 3y + x + 2y = 4x + 1x + 3y + 2y = 5x + 5y

Let us simplify 10p + 4k + p - k'10p + 4k + p - k = 10p + 1p + 4k - 1k = 11p + 3k

Example 2

There are 25 boys and 15 girls in a Grade 4 class. There are 28 boys and 11 girls in a Grade 5 class. The price of a pen is p rupees and the price of an eraser is q rupees. Find the total amount of money needed to give a pen to each boy in Grade 4, an eraser to each girl in Grade 4, an eraser to each boy in Grade 5 and a pen to each girl in Grade 5.

The money needed to give pens and erasers to the students in Grade 4 = 25p + 15q

The money needed to give pens and erasers to the students in Grade 5 = 11p + 28q

The money needed to give pens and erasers to the students in Grade 4 and Grade 5 = 25p + 15q + 11p + 28q = 25p + 11p + 15q + 28q = 36p + 43q

12.5 Substituting values for the unknowns in an algebraic expression

When x = 2, the expression x + 3 takes the value 5. You have learnt in grade 6 that giving a numerical value to the unknown term in an algebraic expression in this manner is called substitution. By substitution, an algebraic expression gets a value.

Let us consider the expression x + 3. When x = 2"x + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5.

Let us find the value of 3x - 5 when x = 4.

3x - 5 = 3 × 4 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

Let us find the value of 4a - 3 when a = 2.4a - 3 = 4 × 2 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5
