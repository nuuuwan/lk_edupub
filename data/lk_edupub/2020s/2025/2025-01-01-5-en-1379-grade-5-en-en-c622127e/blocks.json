Anything will do \u2013 pens, books, pencils, rulers etc. Then take out the shopping bags and randomly put the students\u2019 items into the bags, so that each bag has three different items in them. Make sure students don\u2019t see which bags you put their items in. Now, give each student a bag and ask them to look inside their bag. If anyone has any of their own personal items in their bag they must bring them back to the table at the front, and then put them in different student\u2019s bags. The idea is to make sure each student has a bag with three items in, none of which are their own.Tell students that they must find their items and buy them back!Divide the toy money so that everyone has the same amount.",
