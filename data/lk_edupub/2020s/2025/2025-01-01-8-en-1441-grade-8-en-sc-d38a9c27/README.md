9.1 Human excretory system and excretory products

Exhaled air (carbon dioxide, water)

Urine(urea, uric acid, water, salts)

Sweat (urea, uric acid, water, salts)

Figure 9.1 Excretory products of a human

The biological processes that take place within the cells, produce different products that are useful to the body as well as useless to the body.

As an example, let us consider the respiration reaction. In respiration glucose react with oxygen and produce energy, carbon dioxide and water.

Energy is used for the biological processes in the body. But carbon dioxide and water may become harmful to cells when there is an excess amount.

The useless products that are produced during chemical reactions within the cells are known as excretory products. You can observe the Figure 9.1 to study about the excretory products in human body.

Excretory products can damage the cells when accumulated in excess amount. Some products may be toxic. Therefore, it is very important to remove the excretory products from the body. The process that remove the excretory products from the body is known as excretion.

Waste matter remaining after food has been digested is known as faeces. As it is not produced by chemical reactions within the cells in the digestive system, it is not considered as an excretory product.

Human organ systems9

Science | Human organ systems2

There are organs and systems that are specialized to perform the function of excretion in human body. Table 9.1 shows the excretory products, where they are produced and how they are excreted.Table 9.1

These nitrogenous by-products are excreted from the body through kidneys as urine. Therefore, the urinary system is considered as the main nitrogenous excretory system of human body.

Let us do Activity 9.1 to identify the parts of the human urinary system.

Activity 9.1

You will need:- A model/ diagram of the human urinary systemMethod: -

²²Observe the parts of the urinary system.²²Draw a diagram and name the parts.

The labelled diagram of urinary system of human is shown in Figure 9.2.

Figure 9.3 The way to observe the location of kidneys externally

As shown in Figure 9.3 place your hands on your hips. Then the tips of your thumbs give an indication of the location of the lower end of kidneys.

Kidneys reside against the back muscle in the upper abdominal cavity. They sit opposite each other on either side of the spine. The right kidney is little bit lower than the left kidney to accommodate the liver.

Renal vein

In an adult each kidney is about 13 cm long and 6 cm wide. Kidneys are bean-shaped organs. Observe Figure 9.4 to get an idea about the external structure of a kidney.

The renal artery supplies blood to the kidney while the renal vein carries away the blood from kidneys.

Do Activity 9.2 to study about the internal structure of a kidney.

Activity 9.2

You will need:- A model/photograph of a kidneyMethod: -

²²Study the internal structure of a kidney using a model/ photograph of a kidney in your laboratory.²²Get the assistance of your teacher.

Science | Human organ systems4

The labelled diagram of human kidney is shown in Figure 9.5.

Figure 9.5 Longitudinal section of human kidney

Renal artery

Renal vein

Renal cortex

Renal medulla

Renal pelvis

Ureter

A kidney consists of two major parts.

²²Cortex

²²Medulla

Renal cortex consists of lot of blood capillaries. Therefore, it is dark in colour. Within the renal medulla there are triangular shaped structures called renal pyramids. The tips of these renal pyramids are directed to the renal pelvis. The renal pelvis narrows and open into the upper end of the ureter.

Blood with excretory products transported by renal arteries is filtered in the kidneys. The filtered excretory products are carried by the ureter to the bladder and they are temporarily stored in the bladder. The fluid with excretory products is known as urine.

Components of urine

² Water ² Salts (more sodium chloride)

² Urea ² Uric acid

For extra knowledge

Components of urine of a healthy person is given below as percentages;

Water - about 96% Urea - about 2% Salts - about 2% Uric acid - trace amounts

Above mentioned values and colour of urine are important in diagnosing kidney diseases.

Science | Human organ systems5

When the bladder is full, a person urinates through the urethra to eliminate the waste.

If the kidneys are damaged, the process of excretion does not happen the way they should. Some examples of kidney diseases and the reasons are given below.

Figure 9.6 How kidney stones are formed

²²Kidney stones

Salts such as calcium oxalate deposit in kidneys and form crystalline structures. These structures are known as kidney stones (Figure 9.6). Kidney stones may occur, due to following reasons.

--Not drinking enough water

--Taking salty diets regularly

--Not passing urine at proper time (when wanted)

²²Kidney failure

Functioning of kidneys get disordered and it is called kidney failure. Kidney failure may occur due to following reasons.

--Entering of heavy metals and toxic chemicals into the body

--Suffering from diabetes for a long time

--Using drugs for a long time period for certain diseases

--Smoking and consuming alcohol

²²Kidney infection

The urethra can be infected by microorganisms and it may cause kidney damage.

Excretory process should be carried out efficiently in the body. For this purpose maintaining healthy kidneys is very important. Following are some tips that should be considered to maintain healthy kidneys.

²²Drinking enough pure water daily

²²Limit consuming too much salty and sour food (pickle, lime pickle, food with vinegar)

²²Quit smoking and consuming alcohol

Science | Human organ systems6

²²There is a risk of kidney failure for the persons who are suffering from diabetes. Therefore, it is important to control the blood sugar levels.

²²If a person takes medications regularly over a prolonged period, he should take them to the prescribed dosage by the physician and should have regular tests to check kidney functions.

²²One should concern about the cleanliness of the surrounding area of the urethra because this area can be infected very easily.

9.2 Nervous system

Imagine how a cricketer hits a ball. We know that he coordinates many organs in the body/ body parts to hit the ball in the proper way. Mainly, he coordinates the eyes, hands, legs and neck to hit the ball properly. If these organs do not coordinate in the proper manner his hit will not be successful.

Figure 9.7 A cricketer hits the ball

Think about which body organs coordinate when you drive or put a thread to a needle.

Following flow chart shows the relevant process of hitting the ball.

Seeing the ball (eye)

Hitting the ball

(muscles in hands, neck and legs)

Proper coordination among the organs

According to the above, seeing the ball is a sense. It occurs through the sensory organ called the "eye". The eye is the receptor. Hitting the ball is the reaction. Muscles in the eye, neck, hands and legs are used for the reaction.

Science | Human organ systems7

Let us focus on how the organs are coordinated in seeing and hitting the ball.

Many changes occur within the internal body of humans as well as in his surrounding environment. Body should react for these changes. To react, there should be a very good interaction between the receptors (eye, ear, nose, tongue, skin) and the effectors (muscles and glands). This process is known as coordination.

The nerves and hormones are very important in coordination. Coordinating and controlling the various functions of our body by the nervous system is known as nervous coordination. Coordinating the body organs through hormones is known as chemical coordination.

Nervous coordination

Let us study about the human nervous system.

Major parts of the human nervous system is given below.

Human nervous system

Central nervous systemPeripheral nervous system

Spinal cordBrain

Central nervous system

The two main organs of the central nervous system are the brain and the spinal cord. The central nervous system is better protected in the body. Its main line of defense is the bones. The bones around the brain is known as the skull and spinal cord is surrounded by the vertebral column. Both the skull and vertebral column create a hard physical barrier to injury.

Both the brain and the spinal cord are protected by layers of special connective tissues called the meninges.

The functions of each part of the central nervous system differs.

²²Cerebrum/cortex - Controls higher brain functions such as thought, intelligence

Recognition of senses

Controls the movements of muscles with the intent to perform a specific action (controlling the voluntary

actions)

²²Cerebellum - Regulation and coordination of body balance

²²Medulla - Controls the autonomic functions (non-voluntary Oblongata functions) such as heart beat, breathing

²²Spinal cord - Relays messages from the brain to different parts of the body

Science | Human organ systems9

Spinal nerves

Cranial nerves

Figure 9.9 Peripheral nervous system

Peripheral nervous system

All the nerves that lie outside the spinal cord and brain are known as the peripheral nervous system.

The nerves that lead directly from the brain are called cranial nerves. There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves.

The nerves that arise from the spinal cord are called as spinal nerves. In humans there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves.

Cranial nerves

Peripheral nervous system

Spinal nerves

Functions of peripheral nervous system

²²Transmitting impulses from receptors to the central nervous system

²²Transmitting impulses from central nervous system to the effectors

An electrical signal that travels along a nerve is called an impulse.

Engage in Activity 9.3 to study the speed of impulses in human nerve.

Science | Human organ systems10

Activity 9.3

You will need:- 30 cm ruler

Method:-

²²As shown in Figure 9.10 take the 30 cm ruler to your hand vertically (the “0” of the ruler towards the ground)²²Free the ruler from the hand and ask your friend to catch it.²²Get the reading of the ruler where your friend touched with the hand.²²Repeat this activity with different students.

Figure 9.10

You will notice that each student gets different readings.

The dropping of the ruler is recepted from the eyes. The message is transmitted to the brain and is returned to the effector, the muscles of the right hand. Then, the right hand responses.

According to the results of Activity 9.3 the speed of impulses differ from person to person.The most important part of our body are the brain and spinal cord. So, it is very important to take necessary protective measures in day-to-day activities since the nervous system is very fragile.

Some protective measures are given below.

who you think have a spinal injury unless it is very necessary. Keep the person absolutely still and safe. Do not allow the body to bend or twist. Keep the person on a wooden flat surface and rush to the nearest hospital.

9.3 Human skin

Skin is the largest organ of the body. It weighs about 4.5 kg and 1-2 mm thick in an adult. Skin mainly consists of two layers.

yy Epidermisyy Dermis

Let us engage in Activity 9.4 to study about the structure of the human skin.

Activity 9.4

You will need:- A diagram/model of the human skin

Method:-

²²Identify the main parts of the human skin.²²Draw a cross sketch of the human skin and name the parts.

Structure of the human skin is shown in Figure 9.12.

Science | Human organ systems12

Epidermis

The outer most layer of skin is epidermis. The epidermis is made up of several layers of cells. The epidermis is heeding thousands of dead cells and replenishing daily. Skin colour is due to melanin- a pigment produced in the epidermis to protect from the sun’s ultraviolet rays.

Dermis

The dermis beneath the epidermis contains hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, muscles, nerve endings and blood vessels (capillaries). The dermis is thicker than the epidermis.

Hypodermis lies beneath the dermis.

Functions of the human skin

• Protective layer of the body

The layers of the epidermis minimize water loss from the body and prevent from dehydration.

Melanin pigments in the cells of the skin protects the body from ultra violet rays.

The secretion from sebaceous gland act as a barrier against microorganism infections. This is a natural defense mechanism.

yyRegulation of body temperature

When the temperature increases in the environment than the body temperature, the sweat glands secrete sweat to release heat.

When the atmospheric temperature is lower than the body temperature, the blood supply to the surface of the skin is decreased and the body temperature is regulated. The secretion of sweat is minimized.

yyActing as a sensory organ

In the dermis, there are nerve endings which detect the pressure, touch and temperature.

Science | Human organ systems13

• Synthesis of vitamin D

Using the energy of sunlight, vitamin D is synthesized in the cells of the skin.

• Excretion

The sweat glands secrete sweat which consists of urea, uric acid, and ammonium salts. Therefore, skin can be considered as an excretory organ.

As the skin is exposed to the environment, there is a possibility to the skin to be infected by microorganisms and waste materials.

Wipe your face with a tissue paper. You will notice that your face becomes clean and there is dust in the tissue paper. Cleanliness and protection help to maintain a healthy skin.

Following are some tips that help to maintain a healthy skin.

²²Have nutritive diet

--Vitamin A and E are essential for a healthy skin. Consuming fresh fruits and vegetables helps to supply vitamin A and E to the skin.--Drink adequate amount of fresh water daily.

²²Be gentle to your skin

--Bath daily (if the person is not sick). --Use a mild soap which does not wipe the oil on your skin.--After wash or bath, gently blot the skin with a towel and do not rub against the skin.

²²Protection from sun

--If you are exposing to the sun for a long period of time wear clothes that covers your skin well.

²²Avoid smoking and smokers

--Smoking narrows the blood vessels in the skin and reduce the circulation of blood. The skin cells get less oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, the skin loses its strength and elasticity and develops wrinkles and looks older.

Science | Human organ systems14

²²Other factors

--Wearing cotton dresses--Do not share your dresses with others--Get medical advices for skin disorders such as pimples and warts--Manage stress and always try to maintain a good mental health

For extra knowledge

Dirty skin is easily infected by microorganisms. Also lack of nutrients lead for

skin disorders. Following figures show some skin disorders.

PityriasisRemoval of skinWarts

EczemaHeel getting dry Acne

Assignment 9.1

You may have used an electric torch when you are going out at night. You can get more light when using an electric torch with more cells.

You can use a line of bulbs to illuminate the environment in ceremonial occasions. In such occasions, colour bulbs can be used to increase the attraction. The bulbs illuminate because an electric source sends a flow of electric charges through them. Such a flow of electric charges is known as an electric current. The path of an electric current is called an electric circuit. A voltage should be supplied to a circuit for the flow of current. Voltage is supplied by an electric source.

Electric current flows only when an electrical source is connected in a closed circuit with conductors. A switch can be used to open or close a circuit when necessary.

Let us find out about making circuits using various electric components and how they work.

It can be observed that the brightness of a bulb increases when more cells are connected as in Figure 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 respectively. When the number of cells are increased, the voltage increases, and the current also increases accordingly.

When the required voltage for an electrical equipment cannot be supplied by a single cell, several cells are connected as in Figure 10.4.

Figure 10.4 In this connection the negative terminal of one cell is connected to the positive terminal of the next one. The negative terminal of the second cell is connected to the positive terminal of the third one and so on.When two or more cells are connected one after the other as described above it is called a series connection.Therefore, such a cell system is known as series cell system. A combination of multiple cells is known as a battery. Two and three cell combinations shown in figure 10.5 are examples for batteries.

²²Parallel cell systems

Another method of connecting the cells in a cell system (battery) is shown in Figure 10.6 (a) and 10.6 (b).

Figure 10.6 (a) Figure 10.6 (b)

In this connection, positive terminals of all the cells are connected to one point and the negative terminals of them are connected to an another point. A connection like this is called a parallel connection. Such a cell system is known as a parallel cell system.Let us do Activity 10.2 to study about parallel cell systems.

²²Then, connect other cells to bulbs and switches as shown in Figure 10.8 and 10.9. Close the switches in each instance and observe the brightness of the bulbs.

²² Close the switches of the circuits as shown in Figure 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9 .²² Compare the brightness of the bulbs.

Science | Electricity 21

The bulbs will light with, more or less the same brightness in all the three instances mentioned above. Thus the current flowing through the bulbs should be equal. When cells are connected in this manner, each cell supplies less current. But, the collection of current supplied by cells is equal to current supplied by one cell. Therefore, when cells are connected parallely bulb can light for a longer time thus cells can last a longer time.

When current should be supplied for a long time to an electrical equipment parallel cell systems are used.

According to Activity 10.3 it is clear that the brightness of the bulbs decreases, with the increase of bulbs connected in series across a voltage supply. But the initial brightness can be obtained by increasing the number of cells. Thus, several low voltage bulbs can be lit from a high voltage supply, when they are connected in series.Parallel bulb systemLet us do Activity 10.4 to study about parallel bulb systems.

10.3 Current controlling components

On various occasions it is necessary to control the amount of current flowing through an electric circuit. There are several components that can be used for this purpose. We can use those components according to the situation. Let us consider, how some of such components can be used.Switches / KeysSwitches or keys are used to turn on or turn off an electric current flow through a circuit when necessary. There are various types of keys. Some simple keys are mentioned below.

Diagram of a Tap key is shown in Figure 10.19 (a). P and Q are the terminals connected to the circuit. When the B end of the metal strip is pressed with your finger, X and Y ends contact each other. Then, the circuit between P and Q is completed. When the finger is released B end of the AB metal strip lifts up as a spring. Hence, circuit is disconnected.This is called one way tap key because it is used to let the current to flow one direction.

10.19 (b). P and Q are the terminals connected to the circuit. There is a gap between the metal blocks made of brass. When the plug rod is inserted into the hole between the gap, the circuit is closed. When the plug rod is removed, circuit is disconnected.Permanent resistors

Obstacle to flow an electric current through a conductor is called the resistance. Components that have the property of resistance are known as resistors.

Copper wires are used to connect circuits because their resistance is very low. Resistance of wires made of nichrome and manganin is very high. Therefore, wires made of metals like nichrome and manganin are used to make resistors.

There are resistors made to certain fixed values in the laboratory. They are known as fixed resistors.

5 Ω

2 Ω

Figure 10.20 Serveral types of fixed resistors

Every electric component has an exact resistance value. Therefore, they also can be considered as permanent resistors.

Science | Electricity26

Activity 10.6

You will need :- A permanent resistor of 2 Ω, a permanent resistor of 5 Ω, a Filament bulb of 2.5 V, two dry cells, an ammeter or milliammeter, a switch, connecting wires Method:-

²²Connect the bulb, the switch, the ammeter or milliammeter and dry cells as shown in Figure 10.21.²²Close the switch and record the ammeter reading. Observe the brightness of the bulb also.²²Then, connect the extra fixed resistor of 2 Ω to this circuit as shown in Figure 10.22.

Figure 10.22

When an extra resistor is connected to an electric circuit, electric current flowing through the circuit is reduced. When the resistance of the circuit increased further current flowing decreases. Therefore, it is clear that the current flowing through a circuit can be reduced by connecting fixed resistors to increase the resistance.

Science | Electricity 27

Variable resistor

Figure 10.23 Variable resistor

The above mentioned fixed resistor has a definite resistance. There are resistors made by connecting several resistors to vary the current flowing through a circuit. They are called variable resistors. Figure 10.23 shows such a variable resistor.

Activity 10.7

You will need:- A Filament bulb, two dry cells, a switch, a milliammeter, a variable resistor, connecting wiresMethod:-

the current flowing through a circuit can be changed using a variable resistor.

However, in a variable resistor like the one shown in Figure 10.23, by changing the resistance a current with a necessary value cannot be obtained.

Science | Electricity28

A rheostat is a variable resistor in which the current with a necessary value can be obtained. Such a rheostat is shown in Figure 10.25.A rheostat is connected to the circuit by the terminals A and C or B and C. Necessary value of the resistance can be adjusted by moving the slider.

Activity 10.8

You will need:- A rheostat, a filament bulb, two dry cells or any other current supply, a switch, an ammeter or a milliammeter, connecting wires

Method:-

²²Connect the bulb, the rheostat, the switch, the milliammeter and the cells to construct the circuit as shown in Figure 10.26.²²Close the switch. The bulb lights and the milliammeter shows the reading relevant to the current flow.²²Then, shift the slider of the rhesotat to and fro. You can observe the change of the brightness of the bulb and milliammeter reading.²²Now, shift the slider of the rheostat to read the values of current you selected, in milliammeter (such as 100 mA, 200 mA, 500 mA)²²According to this activity, it is clear that the current flowing through a circuit can be changed to our requirement using a rheostat.

Light dependent resistor

Figure 10.27 Light dependent Resistor

There are resistors that change their resistance when the intensity of light falling on them changes.Such resistors are known as Light dependent resistors (LDR).

Figure 10.27 shows light dependent resistor.

Science | Electricity 29

Activity 10.9

You will need:- A light dependent resistor, a filament bulb, a milliammeter, two dry cells (1.5V), a switch, an electric torch

Method:-

²² Construct the circuit connecting the bulb, the milliammeter, the light depentent resistor, the switch and the dry cells as shown in Figure 10.28.

²² First, cover the light dependent resistor, so that no light falls on it. Record the observations.

²² Then, remove the cover and let light in the environment falls on the light dependent resistor. Record the observations.

²² Next, light the electric torch and direct its light on the light dependent resistor. Record the observations.

²² Discuss the reasons for your observations.

mA

Figure 10.28

When light falls on a light dependent resistor its resistance decreases. Therefore, current flowing through the circuit increases.

When the intensity of light falling increases, the resistance decreases. Therefore, current flowing through the circuit increases further.

Hence, the light dependent resistor can be used to control the electric current flowing through a circuit.

Soldering toolsHave you ever constructed an electrical circuit ? In those instances what is the method you used to connect the components to the circuit. Most probably you may have used a type of adhesive tape. Sometimes the joints are not properly connected when adhesive tapes are used. Then, the circuit does not work properly. As a solution to those problems, the joints are soldered when componets of circuits are assembled.

Let us find out how this soldering is done. A tool, shown in Figure 10.29 (a) is used for this purpose. When electricity is supplied to the tool the tip of this tool gets heated. So, the melted soldering lead is applied to the joints of the circuit. Then joints are firmly connected by soldering lead and are not disconnected.

Science | Electricity30

(a) Soldering tool (Soldering iron)(c) Soldering(b) Soldering lead

Figure 10.29 How soldering is done

For your attention

The tip of the soldering tool gets highly heated, therefore some materials that come into contact, can be burnt.

Therefore, soldering tool should not be kept on things that are damaged by heat. So this tool should be carefully handled.

10.4 Household electrical appliances

Electricity is very important for various day-to-day work. Electricity is one of the ways used to gain energy. Electrically powered equipment can be used to ease our work and do it efficiently and economically. Those electrically powered equipment are known as electrical appliances.

For your attention

The voltage in Volts (V) that should be supplied and the power in Watts (W) of an appliance at that voltage is mentioned on it. If a voltage, higher than that is mentioned is supplied, the appliance will be damaged.

Assignment 10.3

²²List out the electrical appliances used in your home and in your school.

²²Tabulate those appliances according to their use.

Lighting1.2.3.

Science | Electricity 31

Cooking

1.2.3.4.

Air conditioning1.2.

Communication1.2.3.Other (mention the use)

There are some important facts that should be considered when using electrical appliances.

1. Selection of an appliance to suit the need

e.g. 1 :- When reading books at night, you can use a table lamp with a bulb of

5W/ 10W instead of 40 W bulb.

e.g. 2 :- A rice cooker of 240 V/ 700 W is suitable to cook rice for a few people,

and a rice cooker of 240V/ 2000W is suitable to cook rice for a group.

The number of electrical units used, can be reduced by selecting appliances appropriately. Hence, the expenses for household electric bill can be reduced.

2. Selection of an efficient appliances

The efficiency of appliances is indicated on some of them. such information is useful to select more efficient appliances.

e.g.:- CFL of 240 V/14 W gives an intensity of light equal to a filament bulb

of 240V/ 60 W or LED of 240V/ 7W. Therefore, it is suitable to use a 240 V / 14 W of CFL or 240V/ 7W of LED instead of a filament bulb.

Science | Electricity32

3. Safe use of appliances, so that user and the others are out of dangerSome examples are given below.

e.g. 1:- It is important to operate electrical appliances away from water taps,

places of leaking water, hearths and fire.e.g. 2:- Test whether the connecting wires are damaged before using the

appliances.e.g. 3:- Refrain from wrong practices when connecting plug tops to plug bases.

4. Usage of household electric circuit and the appliances without getting

damagedHousehold electric circuits may be short circuited when they are being used. Then, the circuit may fuse and the components may be damaged. Therefore, care should be taken before using electrical appliances.It is not suitable to use several high power electrical appliances when they are connected to the same socket. For instance, when several appliances like electric iron, refrigerator, electric ovens, washing machine and grinder are connected to the same socket it draws a large current from the household electric circuit. This causes heating of the connecting wires and as a result they can catch fire. Usage of such a high current is called over loading.10.5 Heating effect of electric current

When an electric current is flowing through a wire, electric energy is tranformed to heat. Therefore, the conducting wires get heated. This is called the heating effect of electric current.

Activity 10.10

You will need:- A filament bulb (2.5 V), two electric cells, a switch, connecting wiresMethod:-

²²Connect the bulb, two electric cells and the switch as shown in Figure 10.30.²²Touch the glass cover of the bulb.²²Close the switch and let electric current flow for few seconds.²²Touch the glass cover of the bulb again. (As it is dangerous to touch an electric bulb or a part of a circuit, refrain from touching electric circuit without the teacher's instructions.)

Figure 10.30

You will feel that the bulb has heated after the flow of electricity for some time. This reveals the heating effect of current.

Science | Electricity 33

Activity 10.11

You will need:- A nichrome wire and a copper wire of same length (30 cm) and thickness, a piece of plank, three nails, a dry cell, a switch, connecting wires, a hammer

Method:-

²²Fix the three nails A,B and C on the plank, keeping 30 cm gap between each other as shown in Figure 10.31.²²Tie the copper wire between A and B nails and nichrome wire between B and C nails. Both wires should be well stretched.²²Then, connect the nails A and C of the plank to the switch and the dry cell with connecting wires as shown in Figure 10.31.²²Touch the copper and nichrome wires. Then, close the switch for about one minute to allow current to flow and touch the two wires again. (As it is dangerous to touch a part of a circuit, refrain from touching electric circuits without the teacher's instructions.)²²Discuss the observations.

ABC

Figure 10.31

Copper wireNichrome wire

Here, same electric current flows through both wires. But nichrome wire is heated more than the copper wire.

For extra knowledge

Resistance of wires made of nichrome and manganese is higher than that of wires made of copper or aluminium.

Heating effect of an electric current depends on the resistance and the current flowing through a conductor.When the resistance of the conductor is high, more heat is generated. When the current flowing through the conductor is high, more heat is generated.Resistance of a conductor depends on the material it is made of, its length and its thickness (area of cross section).Therefore, very thin, long nichrome wires are used in electrical appliances in which, heat is generated using heating effect of electricity. In our day-to-day life there are electrical appliances that use heating effect of electricity as well as the appliances where the same effect is disadvantageous.

Science | Electricity34

Assignment 10.4

²²List out some day-to-day appliances in which the heating effect of electricity is effectively used.

²²Tabulate the appliances, you identified according to their use.Table 10.4

Name of the appliancePurpose

Heating effect of electricity is a disadvantage in some electrical appliances. Various methods are used to avoid damages that happen due to the heat generated in them. e.g.:-

²²Heating effect of electricity is a disadvantage in some electrical appliances such as computers. Cooling fans are used to cool such appliances.²²Heavy duty semi conductors such as transistors produce heat. Therefore, heat sink is used to cool the appliance.

Cooling fansHeat sink Figure 10.32

For extra knowledge

Nichrome is an alloy. It is made by mixing nickel, chromium and iron.

Science | Electricity 35

10.6 Light effect of electric current

Junctions of most junction diodes get heated when electric current flows through them. It happens because part of the electric energy is emitted as heat energy at the junction.

In some junction diodes, part of the electric energy is emitted as light energy at the junction. Then, the junction is illuminated. This emission of part of the electric energy as light energy is known as the light effect of electric current. Such diodes that emit light are known as Light emitting diodes (LED).

Activity 10.12

You will need:- Several LEDs of various colours (red, green, blue), a multicolour LED, connecting wires, a switch, two dry cells

Method:-

²²Prepare the circuit by connecting an LED, the switch and two dry cells using connecting wire as shown in Figure 10.33.²²Close the switch and observe the LED.²²Connect each LED to the circuit and observe the colour of light emitting.

Various light emitting diodes

Light emitting diodes emit various colours of light. Colour of the light emitted depends on the compound used to make the junction of LED.

Some LEDs emit several colours. They are known as multi colour LEDs.

LEDs are used for light decorative purposes as well as indicators to show whether circuit equipment are in active mode.

There is a high demand for lamps made of LEDs than for other types of electric lamps and bulbs because of the prevailing energy crisis. The reason for this is the higher efficiency of LED lamps, than the other types of lamps.

When an LED is being connected to a circuit the positive and negative terminals should be connected correctly.

There is a minimum voltage that should be supplied to an LED to light it. Voltage supplied should exceed that minimum value for the LED to light it up.

10.7 Magnetic effect of electric current

You may have seen that iron nails and pins are attracted to a magnet. Same way you can see that the indicator is deflected when a compass is brought colse to a magnet.

When a compass is kept close to a current carrying conductor also, its indicator deflects. When the current flowing through the conductor is stopped, indicator of the compass returns to its initial position. It happens because a magnetic field is generated by an electric current carrying conductor. This phenomenon is known as the magnetic effect of electric current.

Activity 10.13

You will need:- A compass, a piece of plank 20 cm x 5 cm, two iron nails, copper wire, a dry cell, a bulb, a switch

Method:-

²²Stretch well and tie the copper wire to the nails. Connect the two ends of the copper wire to the bulb to the dry cell and to the switch as shown in Figure.

²²Place the compass under the stretched copper wire. Turn the wire to north-south direction of the earth. So, that the copper wire and the compass needle will be parallel to each other.

Science | Electricity 37

²²Now, close the switch. The bulb will light and a deflection of the compass needle can be observed.

²²Open the switch again. The bulb will not illumintate and the compass needle will turn back to its initial position.

10.8 Chemical effect of electric current

You can see a gas bubbling around a piece of zinc, dipped in diluted hydrochloric acid. It happens because of the chemical reaction between zinc and hydrochloric acid.Acidulate about 200 ml of water in a beaker with a few drops of hydrochloric acid. Dip two copper plates or rods which are connected to the terminals of a dry cell into this beaker. You can see a gas bubbling near the plates. Here the electrical energy is converted to chemical energy. This phenomenon is known as the chemical effect of elctric current.

Science | Main biological processes in plants46

Plants are considered as the main living component that contributes much for the proper existence and security of environment.

Plants carryout a number of biological processes for their existence. Let us study about such biological processes taken place inside plants.

11.1 Photosynthesis

Plants are autotrophic; which means they can produce their own food. Hence, plants contribute for the existence of themselves as well as animals.

Observe Figure 11.1 to study about photosynthesis, that is the biological process carried out by the plants to produce food.

Carbon dioxide

Figure 11.1 The essential factors and the products of photosynthesis

Main biological processes in plants11

Science | Main biological processes in plants 47

Leaf is the main organ, which produce food. The factors necessary for photosynthesis and the method of obtaining these factors are given below.

²² Carbon dioxide :-Enters into the leaf through stomata from atmosphere

²² Water :-The root hairs absorb water from soil. Then, it is transported to the leaf through the xylem.

²² Chlorophyll :-A green colour pigment which is found within the chloroplast in cells. They absorb light.

²² Light energy :-Chloroplast absorb the light energy from the sunlight fallen on the surface of the leaf.

Food is produced in an organ called chloroplasts, which can be found in plant cells.

Photosynthesis is the process of producing food in chlorophyl containing cells, using CO2 and water by absorbing light energy from the light. The products of photosynthesis are glucose and oxygen.

The reaction of photosynthesis can be given as the following word equation.

Carbon dioxide + Water Light energy

Chlorophyll Glucose + Oxygen

Glucose, produced in leaves is converted into starch in the leaves. Later this starch is converted to sucrose and transported to the necessary places of the plant (growing parts and storage organs).

Science | Main biological processes in plants48

Let us do the Activity 11.1 to test whether photosynthesis has taken place in leaves. If the leaves contain starch and thus we can come to a conclusion that photosynthesis has taken place in leaves.

Activity 11.1

You will need:- A beaker, watch glass, tripod, bunsen burner, some leaves that are exposed to the sun light well (sun flower/chilli/drumstick), alcohol, boiling tube, iodine solution, forcepsMethod :-

²²Dip the leaves in hot water and boil.²²Then put them into a boiling tube with alcohol and boil them in a water bath as shown in Figure 11.2 b until the leaves become colourless.

Leaf boiled in waterWater

a - boiling in waterb - boiling in alcohol in a water bath Figure 11.2 Preparing the leaves for the test

AlcoholWater

²²Take the leaves away and wash well. Keep them on the watch glass and put some iodine drops on to the leaves.²²Note the observations.

Iodine

You will observe that the leaves turn into dark blue colour when iodine is added. Iodine is an indicator that turns to dark blue in the presence of starch. So, this experiment demonstrates that the leaves perform photosynthesis and produce starch, when necesary conditions are supplied.

Science | Main biological processes in plants 49

Let us do the Activity 11.2 to study that oxygen is produced during photosynthesis.

Activity 11.2

You will need:- A funnel, some aquatic plants, water, a trough, boiling tube, a glowing splinterMethod :-

²²Fill the jar with water and keep some Hydrilla plants. Place the funnel as shown in Figure 11.4. Close the free end of the funnel with the boiling tube filled with water. ²²Expose the set-up to sunlight. ²²Note your observations.²²Take the boiling tube out carefully and insert a glowing splinter into the boiling tube.²²Observe what happens.

Collected gasLight energy

Figure 11.4

Trough

You will observe that air bubbles released from the plants and get collected in the upper part of the test tube. You must take the test tube out very carefully and insert the glowing splinter. You will see the glowing splinter reignite and bursting into flame indicating the presence of oxygen inside the test tube. So, you can come to conclusion that oxygen is produced during photosynthesis.

Figure 11.5 Releasing oxygen gas from submerged aquatic plants

Have you seen air bubbles coming out from a fish tank during the day time? The air bubbles are oxygen, a product of photosynthesis. Now you can understand the importance of growing aquatic plants in fish tanks.

Science | Main biological processes in plants50

Photosynthesis is important for the existence of the living world. Let us engage in Assignment 11.1 to study the importance of photosynthesis.

Assignment 11.1

Collect and compile a report on the global importance of photosynthesis to display on your wallpaper.

Figure 11.6 shows the description of the global importance of photosynthesis.

Have you ever thought about the ways that plants intake the raw materials for photosynthesis and how the products are transported to the different parts of the plant ? You will understand how it happens with further studies.

11.2 Transportation

Plants in taking the raw materials for different biological processes and taking the products of these processes to the appropriate places of the plant is known as transportation. Some examples are given below.

²²Transportation of atmospheric air through the stomata to the cells of the leaves.²²Transportation of water and minerals from soil to the leaves through root hairs.²²Transportation of food produced by photosynthesis from leaves to the other parts of the plant.There should be a mechanism within the plants for transportation. Let us do Activity 11.3 to study about it.

11.2.1 Diffusion

Activity 11.3

You will need :- Condis, water, a beakerMethod:-

²²Fill the beaker with water.²²Put some condis into it.²²Observe how the particles spread throughout water.

Figure 11.7 How condis particles spread throughout water

Spreading of condis in water can be described using Figure 11.8

Figure 11.8 Spreading of condis particles in water

Condis High concentration

Condis Low concentration

When the cube of condis is put into water more particles of condis can be seen around the cube. That is the concentration of condis particles is high around the cube, which means there are more condis particles within a unit volume. There is less amount of condis particles in the upper part of the water beaker. Condis particles move randomly from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. This movement of particles occur not only in the liquid but also in the gas medium.

Science | Main biological processes in plants52

When skin of an orange is peeled off, the smell can be felt for a person who is even a little far away. That is because the orange skin contains volatile materials. These volatile materials randomly move through the air from the higher concentrated area to the low concentrated area. Spreading the smell of joss sticks and the smell of perfumes is also done according to the above method.

The process in which a movement of a substance from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration is called diffusion.

Diffusion is one of the main processes in plants that helps for the transpotation of substances.

Following are some instances where diffusion takes place.

²² Diffusion of carbon dioxide from atmosphere to the plant leaves through

stomata for photosynthesis.

²² Diffusion of oxygen through stomata to the leaves for respiration.

²² Oxygen, a product of photosynthesis diffusing out of the stomata to the

atmosphere.

²² The products of respiration, carbon dioxide and water vapour diffusing from

stomata to the atmosphere.

11.2.2 Osmosis

Assignment 11.2

Uproot a Balsam plant carefully without breaking the roots. Wash soil in the roots. Put some water into a container and dissolve some red ink in it. Now, dip the plant in the water you prepared with ink. Observe after few hours.

Figure 11.9 Ink solution goes up through the stem You will see that roots absorb the red ink solution and it goes up to the stem. There is a mechanism that water particles and ink particles travel through the root cells and enter the xylem tissue.

Thus, there is a mechanism that water particles travel from cell to cell. To study about this mechanism let us do Activity 11.4.

Science | Main biological processes in plants 53

Activity 11.4

You will need:- A thistle funnel, a piece of colourless cellophane, 500 ml beaker, rubber bands threads, salt solution, water, condis solutionMethod :-

²²Fill the beaker with water.

²²Cover the mouth of the funnel with the piece of cellophane.

²²Place the funnel in the beaker and put condis solution and salt solution into the funnel.

²²Mark the starting level in the thistle funnel.

²²Note your observations after a few minutes.

Figure 11.10 (a) before

Figure 11.10 (b) after

Thistle funnel

Salt solution with condis

Cellophane layer

Water

After few minutes, you will observe that the level of the liquid in the funnel rises up and the colour of the condis is faded.

The reason for the rising up the level of liquid can be explained as below.

The concentration of water molecules is higher in the beaker compared to the solution in the thistle funnel. So, water molecules tend to move from area of higher concentration (beaker) to area of lower concentration (thistle funnel) across the cellophane. Cellophane allows only the water molecules to pass through and prevents salt and condis molecules to get in. Such membranes are called semipermeable membranes.

Science | Main biological processes in plants54

A semipermeable membrane allows only some selected molecules to pass through.You can do the same experiment using an egg membrane instead of the cellophane. Egg membrane is also considered as a semipermeable membrane.

Diffusion of water molecules through a semipermeable membrane from an area of higher water concentration to an area of lower water concentration is known as osmosis.

To study about the osmosis let us do Assignment 11.3.

Assignment 11.3

• Take a petiole of a papaw leaf (with a closed end) and fill it with a salt solution. Place it in a water container as in Figure 11.11.

• Observe what happens.

Figure 11.11

Many minerals are dissolved in soil water. The root hairs of plants absorb these water particles by osmosis. From root hair up to the xylem, water particles move from cell to cell by osmosis. The cell membrane inside the cell wall act as a semipermeable membrane.

Science | Main biological processes in plants 55

Root hairs absorb water by osmosis. Energy is not needed for this. But energy is needed to absorb minerals. Food produced in leaves are also transported to the other parts of the plant through the phloem tissues. These photosynthetic products are transported as a unit along the phloem tissues and that process is known as mass flow.

Some methods of transportation in plants are given below.

²²Diffusion

²²Osmosis

²²Mass flow

11.3 Transpiration

Let us engage in Activity 11.5 to identify another important biological process that takes place in the plants.

Activity 11.5

You will need:- A potted plant, transparent polythene bag, rubber bandsMethod :-

²²Cover a branch of the plant using a polythene bag.²²Observe after one hour.

Figure 11.13

You will notice that there are droplets in side the polythene bag. When some anhydrous copper sulphate crystals are put on the droplets the crystals turn from white to blue. So, that you can conclude that the droplets were water droplets.

These water droplets mainly come out from the leaves.

The process of evaporation of water through the aerial parts of a plant is termed as transpiration. This happens mainly through the stomata in leaves.

Engage in Activity 11.6 to show that plants absorb water to fill the gap of water due to transpiration.

Science | Main biological processes in plants56

Activity 11.6

You will need:- A leafy shoot (you should cut this under water), coconut oil, rubber cork, grease/paraffin, "U" tube, waterMethod :- ²²Fill the "U" tube with water.

²²Cut a leafy shoot under the water and fix it to the rubber cork and fix the cork to the one arm of the "U" tube.

²²Seal it using grease and put some coconut oil to the other arm of the "U" tube and mark the level of water.

²²After an hour observe the water level in the arm with coconut oil.

Leafy shoot

"U" tubeWater

Figure 11.14

Coconut oil

You will observe that the water level in the free arm of the "U" tube decreases. The shoot loses water through transpiration. Therefore, it absorbs the same amount of water from the "U" tube. This is the reason for the decreasing of water level in the free arm of the "U" tube.

The speed of the transportation within the plants increases due to transpiration. In addition to this there are some other functions of transpiration. They are,

²²The transpiration pull is responsible for the continuous ascent of water and nutrients from the roots to the top most parts of the plants.

²²As the water is evaporated, transpiration helps the plant in cooling.

²²Maintains the water cycle by evaporating water.

Therefore, transpiration is a process, favourable not only for the plants but also for the environment.

Severe heat, strong wind, strong light increase the rate of transpiration. Transpiration during dry condition may affect the plant to dry. There are many adaptations of plants that live in such weather conditions to conserve water. Recall what you have studied in chapter 3.

Science | Main biological processes in plants 57

Some adaptations are given below.

²²Thick epidermis in aerial parts e.g. - Temple trees

²²Leaves reduced to spines e.g. - Cactus

²²Leaves turned to scale leaves e.g. - 'Kasa'/ 'Savukku'

²²Reducing the size of leaves e.g. - 'Navahandi'/ 'Kally'

²²Hairs on epidermis e.g. - Sun flower, Pumpkin

²²Sunk stomata e.g. - Oleander

²²Leaves fall during the dry season e.g. - Rubber, Teak

²²Fleshy leaves e.g. - Aloe

²²Rolled leaves during dry seasons e.g. - 'Maha ravana reula'/ 'Ravanan meesai'

- 'Bim thamburu' / 'Vatralai'11.4 Guttation

Figure 11.15

When the humidity is high at nights the margins and tips of leaves in some plants such as anthurium, acacia ooze liquid drops. Think for a while the reason for these droplets.

At night the percentage of water vapour in the atmosphere is high and transpiration occurs very rarely. Therefore, the margins and the tips of leaves in small plants secrete water in the liquid form. They are exuded from the hydathodes.

The process of water being exuded in the liquid form through hydathodes of the leaves is known as guttation.

Guttation occurs from the tips of the plants such as 'habarala'/'nersshembu', anthurium, grass etc. and from the margins of the plants such as potato, tomato etc. The water in the droplets, release from guttation gets evaporated during the day time. But the salt get left behind and can burn the tips of the leaves. You would have seen such burns in the plants such as 'habarala'.

Science | Main biological processes in plants58

The differences between transpiration and guttation are shown in Table 11.1

Table 11.1 Transpiration Guttation

1. Water release in the form of water

Water release in the form of drops/liquid.

2. Occurs mainly through stomata.Occurs through hydathodes

3. Only pure water is released.Water and salts are released

4. Occurs during both day and night

time.Mostly occurs during night.

5. When humidity in the atmosphere

is increased, rate of transpiration is decreased.

When humidity in the atmosphere is high, it increases the guttation.

Summary

²²Plants are considered as the main living component that contributes much for the proper existence and security of environment.

²²Plants ensure their existence by the biological processes.

²²Some biological processes carried out by the plants are photosynthesis, transportation and transpiration.

²²It is important to transport water, a raw material of photosynthesis to the leaves and also starch, a product of photosynthesis to the necessary parts of the plant.

Science | Life cycles of living organisms62

By observing the environment carefully you will notice that all living beings are born from an egg / a seed or as a small creature, and they pass through many different stages. A grown-up organism produces offspring of its own by the reproductive process. These stages are repeated in each generation through and it ensures the survival of living organisms in the environment.

The sequence of events in stages of development as a cyclic process, which a living organism passes from its birth to death is termed as a life cycle.

Let us do Activity 12.1 to study about the life cycles of living organisms.

Activity 12.1

You will need :- Some pictures of animals with the stages of life cycles

When you have completed arranging the stages of life cycles of plants and animals in order you would have understood that life cycles of organisms can be build up.

12.1 Life cycles of animals

To study about the life cycles of animals engage in Activity 12.2

Activity 12.2

You will need:-Life cycles of butterfly, frog, cockroach, mosquito, rat, humanMethod :-

²²Observe the life cycles well and identify the special characteristics of each stage of animals.

²²Tabulate your observations depending on the differences of shapes/ patterns of the different stages.Table 12.1With different morphological forms of stagesWithout different morphological forms of stages

You would have noticed that there are no different morphological forms in different stages of rat and human, while there are morphological changes in different stages of cockroach, butterfly, mosquito and frog.

Some animals (e.g. :- rat) born morphologically similar to their parents, but smaller in size. Some species have slightly complicated life cycles. That is, they go through different morphological forms before becoming an adult.

Science | Life cycles of living organisms65

Some animals such as butterfly, mosquito, cockroach, frog etc, are hatched from an egg. As the nutrients in the eggs are not sufficient for them to become an adult, they go through different stages. During these stages most of the feeding is done for them to become an adult. Going through different stages in the life cycles ensures their survival.

Also the adaptations of these stages for different environments secure their survival.

There are different stages in human life cycle. Although the infant is differ in body size, he has similar appearance of the adult. The infant goes through the life stages childhood, adolescence and becomes an adult. Stages of human life cycle have approximately the similar morphological features that they will have as human adults.

Figure 12.3 Some stages of human life cycle

Hence, you may have noticed that some organisms who undergo changes with different morphological features while some have similar morphological features in their different stages of life cycle.

Would you have noticed that the egg of the butterfly hatch and a larva is born ? After some days larva becomes a pupa and later becomes a beautiful butterfly with colourful wings. These stages of life cycle have different morphological features.

The process with different morphological changes in different stages of life cycle that some living organisms go through to become adults is referred to as metamorphosis.

Science | Life cycles of living organisms66

Animals like rat and man who do not show morphological differences in life cycles do not have metamorphosis in their development.

Are the morphological changes of different stages of every organism that undergo metamorphosis, significant ? Let us do Activity 12.3 to study about it.

Activity 12.3

You will need:- Some pictures that show the life cycles of frog, cockroach, butterfly, mosquito, grasshopper, white ant

Method :-

²²Observe the pictures well.

²²Are the morphological changes of different stages of every creature significant ?

²²Tabulate your answer.

Table 12.2

The creatures that have significant differences in stages of life cycleThe creatures that do not have significant differences in stages of life cycle

The organisms hatched from eggs of cockroach, grasshopper, termite are smaller in size but they resemble adult in appearance. The creatures hatched from eggs of butterfly, mosquito, frog are completely different from the adult.

Metamorphosis is commonly exhibited by insects and amphibians. Metamorphosis is a reason for successful existence of insects.

There are two common forms of metamorphosis.

²²Complete metamorphosis

²²Incomplete metamorphosis

Science | Life cycles of living organisms67

Metamorphosis with significant morphological differences in the different stages, is known as complete metamorphosis.

The feeding mechanism and locomotion are different in each stage. As an example butterfly larva feeds on plant leaves while moves using legs. The adult butterfly feeds on nectar and flies using wings. e.g. :- Mosquito, butterfly

Figure 12.4 Life cycles of mosquito and butterfly showing complete metamorphosis

Metamorphosis that does not show any significant morphological changes in the stages of life cycle is known as incomplete metamorphosis.

The young hatched from the egg, is known as the nymph. Nymph is morphologically similar to the adult with only slight changes. Nymph does not have wings. They are small in size and not sexually matured.

12.1.1 Life cycle of a frog

The female frog lays eggs in water. The eggs are covered with a jelly type layer. A tiny tadpole emerges from a hatched egg. It is similar to a fish. It can swim in water and breaths using gills. It feeds on aquatic plants as a herbivore.

Several morphological changes take place within water in the tadpole to become an adult (Figure 12.6).

Figure 12.8 Life cycle of a butterfly

12.1.2 Life cycle of a butterfly

Butterfly shows complete metamorphosis. The adult butterfly lays eggs. These eggs hatch and larva emerge. This larva is called a caterpillar. Caterpillar becomes a pupa after sometime. Pupa stays inside a cocoon. It stays inactively without feeding. However there are some changes take place in the body to become an adult.

Science | Life cycles of living organisms70

Specific features in each developmental stage of butterfly is given in Table 12.3.

Assignment 12.3

• Collect some seeds and fruits of some plants, that can be easily found (grass, love grass, chillies, tomato)• Collect the flowers of those plants.• Press them keeping between the pages of a paper, for some days.• Use them and try to present the life cycle of each plant.

12.3 Importance of learning the life cycles

The importance of learning about the life cycles are;

²²For pest control

²²For control of disease vectors

²²For conservae of biodiversity

12.3.1 Pest controlling

An organism that harms or destroys crops, garden plants or trees that are useful for human is known as a pest.

It is important to study the life cycles and the behaviour of these pests in order to control them.

Let us study the life cycle of a fruit fly, a pest insect that involves in destroying the crops a lot (Figure 12.13).

Science | Life cycles of living organisms73

Figure 12.13 Life cycle of a fruit fly

Eggs

Larva

Pupa

Adult fruit fly

The adult female fruit fly lays eggs by pricking the fruits such as mango, guava etc. The larva feeds on the flesh of the fruit, gradually moving in by making tunnels in the fruit. So, the fruits get rotten and become unsuitable for human consumption. The value of the fruit also gets reduced.

Figure 12.14 The damage of the fruit flyThe larval stage is the most likely and easiest way to control the fruit fly.

²²Regular inspection of the fruit is important to can control the fruit fly. If larvae are found in fruits the fruits must be destroyed.

²²The fallen fruits that are infected by larvae should be collected and destroyed.

Activity 12.5

You will need:- Articles or magazines written on pests that destroy crops and their life cyclesMethod :-

²²Make a list of pests that destroy crops.

²²Tabulate your findings in Table 12.14.

The actual methods you can use to control pests and the ways these methods can be used together is based on an understanding of their life cycles. The method used to control the larval stage can not be used to control the adult stage of the pest insect or its any other stage.

Therefore, controlling of pests can be achieved effectively by controlling different stages of their life cycle. Pests can be pest insects and also pest plants that destroy the crops. e.g. :- 'Bajiri', 'Kudametta', 'Thunessa' are pest plants of rice crop

Many pest controlling methods are used to prevent the harm of pests on crops / harvest. It is our duty and the responsibility to protect the living beings in the environment. This will help to conserve the biodiversity and the environmental equilibrium.

The traditional methods of controlling pests used by our ancestors are eco-friendly and nowadays farmers tend to use these methods to control pests.

Engage in Assignment 12.4 to study about the traditional methods.

Assignment 12.4

• Find and list out the traditional methods used in the past to control different stages of pests. • Write your ideas on the importance of those traditional methods.

Science | Life cycles of living organisms75

Nowadays, there is a special attention on eco-friendly pesticides. Obtaining knowledge about the preparation and usage of such pesticides causes environmental protection.

Engage in Assignment 12.5 to study about eco-friendly pesticides.

Assignment 12.5

• Make a list of eco-friendly pesticides that can be used to control the pest insects pests.• Write the raw materials needed to prepare these pesticides.

Use of chemical pesticides can damage the environment by destroying beneficial organisms. This can throw the whole eco-system out of balance. So, chemical control should be applied when the pests cannot be controlled by biological or by simple mechanical methods. Excessive and unsafe use of chemical pesticides may affect the water bodies. These chemicals can accumulate in water. Consuming this contaminated water may cause cancers and kidney diseases.

For extra knowledge

²²When chemical pesticides are used in fruits and vegetables it is very important not to harvest them until the recommended period. If they are harvested before the safe period the toxic chemicals enter the human body. Accumulation of these toxic chemicals for a long time in the body leads to diseases such as cancer, kidney diseases.

²²Therefore, it is very important to wash the fruits and vegetables well before consuming.

Let us do Assignment 12.6 to study the adverse effects of chemical pesticides.

Assignment 12.6

• Design a poster to show the adverse effects of using chemical pesticides.

Science | Life cycles of living organisms76

12.3.2 Control of disease vectors

An agent that carries and transmits pathogens (virus, protozoa) from an infectious organism to a healthy organism is called a disease vector. Mosquito is a disease vector. It acts as the vector of different diseases that human suffers such as dengue, malaria etc.To control the disease vector it is important to know about the life cycle of the organism.

• List out some diseases that are transmitted by mosquito.• Collect information about fish species that prey on mosquito larvae.• List the most suitable methods that can be used to control the adult mosquito.• What are the precautions that can be taken to prevent mosquito breeding ?• Design a poster about controlling mosquito breeding.

12.3.3 Life cycles for conservation of biodiversity

Some stages within the life cycles of some animal species have become threatened within their habitat. Some growth stages of animals can be completely destroyed due to becoming victims of animals, unfavourable environmental conditions and scarcity of food. Such stages can be considered as the sensitive stage of the particular organism. A species may face total extinction if the sensitive stage is destroyed.

Science | Life cycles of living organisms77

Valubale stages of some animals are given below.

²²Some insects- Larvae

²²Fishes

²²Turtles

²²Frogs

- Eggs- Eggs and young turtles- Eggs and tadpoles

To protect the biodiversity it is important to understand about sensitive stages of particular organisms. If pay special attention about the sensitive stages of organism, it would be easier to conserve those organisms. Then, it will help to protect biodiversity.

Summary

²²Every living organism has a life cycle with different stages.

²²Some organisms have significant differences in the stages of life cycle, but some do not have significant differences in the stages.

²²The process with a sequence of morphological changes that some living organisms go through to become an adult is known as metamorphosis.

²²Metamorphosis with significant morphological changes in the stages is known as complete metamorphosis.

²²Metamorphosis without significant morphological changes in the stages is known as incomplete metamorphosis.

²²Flowering plants too go through different stages from growth of the seed till becoming an adult plant in its life cycle.

²²The creatures that harm the crops and harvest of human is called as pests.

²²For a successful pest control there should be a knowledge about the harmful stage of the particular pest.

²²It is important to protect the valubale stages of the life cycle of organisms for conservation of biodiversity.

²²In conservation of endangered species is important to consider about the sensitive stage of the endangered organism.

13.1 Need of food preservation

Food spoils mainly due to the growth and action of microorganisms on food.

e.g. :- Coagulation of milk, growth of mould on bread, spoilage of fish, rancid of

coconut oil

Figure 13.1 Fresh food and spoiled food

In addition to the microbial activity food is also spoiled by the damage caused by macroorganisms such as weevils and grain borers growing on food.

e.g. :- Weevils spoil cereals and pulses such as paddy, gram and green grams

Food, such as vegetables, fruits and cereals become unsuitable for human consumpiton due to not following the correct technological methods during processing. From harvesting to market they are subjected to Bruises, cuts, lacerations, squashes and bumpt. Therefore, such food becomes unconsumable. As microorganisms readily act on such damaged food, they spoil fast.

Natural changes in food occur because of the action of various chemical substances such as enzymes present in food. It is called self degradation.

e.g. :- Maturation, ripening and putrefaction of fruits

Different methods are used to preserve food, and it will help to fulfill the nutrient requirements of man.

Food preservation13

Science | Food preservation81

The process of making food stay longer by artificially controlling the factors affecting food spoilage is called food preservation.

Hence, attempts are made to preserve the nutritional value and other characteristics of the food item during the food preservation.

Aims of food preservation are reduction of food spoilage, prevention of food poisoning and use of excess food by processing to use in off seasons.

Let us engage in Activity 13.1 to distinguish preserved food from several food types.

Activity 13.1

You will need:- Cow milk, rice, fresh fish, a bottle of sterilized milk ('kalkiri'), a packet of dried sprats, dried jak fruit ('atukos'), lime pickle ('lunudehi'), dried fish

Figure 13.2Method:-

²²Keep the samples of food provided to you exposed to air.

²²Observe the colour and texture of those samples everyday for about a week under the guidance of your teacher.

²²Tabulate your observations as follows.

Table 13.1Food typeObservation

Science | Food preservation82

From the observations, it is clear that properties like colour, odour and texture change within a few hours in food items such as cow milk and fresh fish.

It can be observed that in sealed bottled milk ('kalkiri'), 'atukos', dried fish, 'lunudehi' and dried sprats had no observable change in properties such as colour, odour and texture. It is because those food items are preserved.

13.2 Methods of food preservation

In order to preserve food, mainly the factors causing food spoilage should be controlled. Some measures that can be taken are as follows.

²²Preventing microorganisms getting to the food

²²Controlling the temperature and water content of food to minimize the microbial activity

²²Prevention of damage caused by macroorganisms

There are modern methods as well as traditional methods for food preservation.

Traditional methods of food preservation

From the distant past humans have adopted various methods to preserve food. Even today they are used with minor changes.

Assignment 13.1

²²Collect information about the traditional methods used to preserve food.

²²List traditional methods you discovered and provide examples for each of them separately.

Some traditional methods used to preserve food and examples for them are given in Figure 13.3.

Glass or plastic cover

Figure 13.5 Drying food using a solar heat drier

Like in the past solar heat is used to dry food. At present the solar heat drier is used for this purpose (Figure 13.5). Since a closed condition prevails within the drier, more pure and dry food can be obtained within a shorter period of time. Mixing of wastes, damages caused by animals and rain can also be prevented by this.

This method can be used to preserve food items such as chillies, fruits, vegetables etc.

Science | Food preservation84

Stove drying

Figure 13.6 A stove drying food

Ability to give the appropriate temperature for the food that is dried is an advantage of this method. Stoves which use electricity, gas and mineral oil are used for drying food.

This method can be used to preserve food items such as chillies, fruits, mushrooms etc.

Spray drying

Figure 13.7 A machine producing milk powder

When water is removed, milk becomes a dry powder. Hot milk is sprayed onto a heated cylinder with high pressure. Microorganisms do not grow due to lack of water.

²²Temperature control

A favourable temperature (40 oC) is essential for the growth of microorganisms. The growth of microorganisms could be controlled by reducing the temperature to a value that is unfavourable for their growth.

Freezing

The temperature of the food material is kept at a low value than the surrounding temperature. It is important to maintain the temperature of ordinary freezing chambers always below 4 oC.

Deep freezing

The temperature below -18 oC prevailing in deep freezers is adequate to prevent the growth of most microorganisms. By deep freezing the natural colour, taste and nutritive value of food can be protected to a large extent.

Assignment 13.3

²²State some types of food that can be preserved by keeping in a refrigerator.

²²Make a list of food that should be kept in a deep freezer for preservation.

²²Concentration

In canning and bottling, water in food is removed. Hence, the concentration of the food is increased. This controls the growth of microorganisms. The microbial activity is further suppressed by the addition of preservatives.

This method can be used to preserve food items such as jam, cordial etc.

Science | Food preservation86

For extra knowledge

²²Liquid milk can be kept longer by pasteurization. In this method pathogenic bacteria in milk causing diseases are destroyed by heating milk for about 15 seconds at the temperature of 72 oC. Pasteurized milk can be kept for about two weeks in a refrigerator (a).

²²Milk packets you drink have been pasteurized by subjecting to a temperature as high as 138 oC for about 1-2 seconds (Ultra pasteurization). Milk pasteurized by this method can be kept in refrigerators for about 2-3 months when stored in closed containers (b).

²²Milk available in the market under the name 'Kalkiri' is sterilized milk. During sterilization all the microorganisms and the stages are destroyed. In sterilization, milk is heated for about 15 - 20 minutes at the temperature of 120 oC. This milk need not to be kept in a refrigerator for storage. But once opened, it should be kept in a refrigerator (c).

Science | Food preservation88

The substance used to prevent the action of microorganisms causing food spoilage and the effect of other external and internal factors are known as preservatives. Preservatives are a type of additives.

The code (E number) is adopted by the European Union to symbolise the food additives approved for use and are experimentally confirmed as safe.

The preservatives from E 200 to E 299 have been allowed to add to the food as synthetic food additives. Mainly acids and salts can be seen among these.

A few chemical substances prescribed to be used as synthetic food additives are given below.

yySodium metabisulphiteyySodium chlorideyySodium bisulphiteyySodium nitrite and sodium nitrateyyBenzoic acidyyAcetic acid

The additives mentioned above should be those prescribed by the food act in Sri Lanka and it is important that they are added in prescribed quantities. Any preserved food items that are not suitable for children should be clearly stated in the label.

For extra knowledge

Flavours are added to food such as instant food and soup cubes available in the market. But giving flavoured food to children under the age of three years is not safe as far as their health is concerned. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) added to food is a flavour and is not a preservative. Use of these beyond the preseribed dose is not favourable for health. Some food colourings are carcinogenic.

Science | Food preservation89

Let us engage in Activity 13.2 to study the preparation of jam as a preserved type of food.

Activity 13.2

13.5 Information in a label of a food package

Let us do Activity 13.3 in order to study further about the facts we need to take into consideration as customers when buying packaged food items.

Activity 13.3

You will need:- A few labels of packaged food items

Method:-

²²Study well the packets/cartons of the food items and their labels well and list the information relevant to ensure their quality.

Table 13.3

NumberPackaged FoodMethod of preservationAdditivesDate of manufactureDate of expiry

Compare the information you collected with the following.

Some important information given on the label of a packed food item are as follows.

²²Date of manufacture and date of expiry

²²Net weight / Total weight

²²Standard

²²Producer (Institution / Country)

²²Environment friendliness / Consumer friendliness of the packet/ wrapper

Date of manufacture and date of expiry

Food can be packed only for a limited period of time protecting their nutritional quality. As time elapses, physical and chemical changes may take place in food. Moreover, food may get spoiled due to microbial activity.

Net weight / Total weight

The consumer should be aware of the amount of the substance in the package.

Science | Food preservation93

Standard

Figure 13.12 Quality certificate logos of standards

If the food item is prepared according to the standards prescribed by the Sri Lanka Standard Institute, the cover of the package should have the SLS logo along with the relevant numbers. If the food item is prepared according to the International standards the package should have the ISO logo along with the relevant numbers.

Food items with the standard certification are considered to be high in quality.

Assignment 13.7

²²There are instances where quality of the food is adulterated by adding various substances for the purpose of making profit. Be cautious about such instances.

²²Make a list of food items which are adulterated.

²²In each example you mentioned, state the substance added to the food.

Details of the manufacturer

Information about the manufacturer or the country that produces the food item is important for taking legal action in case unexpected results are caused due to consumption of food.

Environment friendly/ consumer friendly nature of the wrapper

Since some food items contain flavours, colourings and preservatives, with time they may react with the packing and form substances injurious for health. These wrappings are harmful for personal health as well as the environment.

Therefore, when buying packaged food, it is very important to pay attention not only to the quality of food but also to all the information given in their labels. Proper packaging is essential to minimize wastage of food during transport. Some of its advantages are:

²²Prevention of the entry of microorganisms and macroorganisms

²²Protection of food from external factors such as air, water (moisture), light and heat

²²Maintenance of quality and quantity of food

²²Facilitation of transport and storage

Science | Food preservation94

For extra knowledge

Only prescribed varieties of plastics can be used to pack food. They are known as super grade plastics.

²² The symbols given in the packaging which are suitable for food are given here.²² Recycled plastics should never be used as food wrappers.²² Plastics used to pack other materials should not be used to pack food.²² Oily or basic food types should not be packed in non- prescribed plastic containers.²²Strongly heated food is not suitable for packaging.

During food preservation synthetic flavours and colourings are added very often. Therefore food is subjected to a complex mode of processing. Hence, it is very important to get used to consume natural food.

Summary

²²Food spoilage is mainly caused by the growth and action of microorganisms on food.

²²Food preservation, is keeping food for a longer period of time by artificially controlling the factors affecting food spoilage.

²²Minimizing food spoilage, utilization of surplus food, ability to consume some food types in the off-season and prevention of food poisoning are the advantages of food preservation.

²²Food preservation descends from the past. At present, food is preserved by modern technological methods.

²²When buying packed food, it is very important to that quality of food as well as the information given in the label, are taken into consideration.

²²It is always favourable to consume natural food whenever possible, in order to maintain good health.

14.1 The solar systemA large number of celestial objects can be observed in the night sky. From ancient time people were curious about those celestial objects. They gathered information by observation of those objects.

Ancient people observed celestial objects with their naked eyes. Later on various instruments were used for this purpose. Telescopes, manned and unmanned space crafts and space stations are some of them.

Due to the information collected since ancient time, now we have the ability of understanding the solar system, which is a large system including the earth. Still the explorations are being carried out about this.

Figure 14.1 The solar systemPlanets rotate around their own axis, while revolving around the sun. Rotational time of a planet is the time taken by the planet to turn once, around its own axis. It is the time span of a day of that particular planet.

e.g. :- The rotational time of the earth is 24 hours. So, that is a day of the earth.

Time of revolution of a planet is the time taken by the planet to revolve once around the sun. That is the year of that particular planet.e.g.:- The time of revolution of the earth is 365.25 days. That is the year of the earth.

Figure 14.3

Consider a dancing event by a dancer to understand the concept of rotation and revolution. A dancer rotates around its own axis. It is called rotation. At the same time the dancer revolves around an imaginary point on the stage. This is called as revolution. (Figure 14.3).

Figure 14.4

A planet rotates around its rotating axis. The path, along which a

planet revolves around the sun is its orbit. All planets have a tilt to its orbital plane, when revolve.

e.g.:- The earth has a tilt of 23.5o the perpendicular axis of its

orbital plane (Figure14.4)There are sub-planets around most of the planets. They also rotate around their axis while revolving around the planet.Mercury and Venus have no sub-planets. Information about the planets of our solar system are given in Table 14.1.

Carry out Activity 14.2 to understand about the distances of planets from the Sun.

Activity 14.2

You will need :- Name boards of planets, measuring tape (in meters), a large yellow coloured balloonMethod:-

²²Mark a point at the centre of the school play ground.

²²Take that point as the centre. Draw circles taking the radius according to the ratio given in the table below. (Use the measuring tape for this purpose)

Figure 14.7 The model of solar system in the school laboratory

Now you have a comprehensive knowledge about the planets. Figure 14.7 shows a model of solar system in the school laboratory.

Engage in Activity 14.3 to study about the revolution of planets around the sun.

Activity 14.3

You will need :- A ball, a strong string of 50 cm in length

Method :-

yy Tie the ball at one end of the strong string of 50 cm long.

yy Take the other free end of the string to hand and rotate the ball fast enough above your head.

yy Now observe, the manner ball rotates around you without falling, until you rotates it.

In this activity you might have observed that the ball rotates in a circular path without attract towards you.

This rotation can be explained as below.

Figure 14.8 Motion of objects around the earth

When the speed increase

When the speed decreaseWhen the speed is constant

Here a force is exerted from your arm to the ball. Therefore, ball is rotating in circular path at a constant speed.

Science | Phenomena and exploration associated with solar system 103

Corresponding to the example given in Figure 14.8, revolution of planets around the sun also, can be explained. Comparative to the force applied by the arm towards the ball, a force is applied by the sun towards the planet that is called gravitational force. The planet should fall on the sun and be destroyed, due to this force. But, this does not happen because of the constant speed of revolution of the planet around the sun.

14.2 Occurance of seasonal changes

Seasonal changes is a phenomenon that occur due to the revolution of the earth around the sun, with a tilt to its orbital plane.

When it is the winter in England which is in the northern hemisphere of the earth it is the summer in Newzealand which is in the southern hemisphere. Let us find out how this happens.

It is known that the earth's axis has a tilt of 23.5o to its orbilal plane. Revolution of the earth with this tilt is the reason for seasonal changes on earth. Let us study how this happens.

Figure 14.9 Occurance of seasonal changes on earth

March 21

June 21

September 23

December 22

Consider the position of the earth (Figure 14.9) on 21st of June. Here, rays of the sun fall perpendicular to the northern hemisphere.

Hence, it is summer to northern hemisphere. Same time rays of the sun fall with an inclination to the southern hemisphere. Therefore, it is cold and is winter to southern hemisphere.

Science | Phenomena and exploration associated with solar system104

Consider the position of the earth on 22nd of December (Figure 14.9). Rays of the sun falls perpendicular to southern hemisphere, and with an inclination to nothern hemisphere. Therefore, winter occur in nothern hemisphere and summer to the southern hemisphere.

Seasonal changes are distinct in polar regions. Countries like Sri Lanka, which are closer to equator, have no distinct seasonal changes.

14.3 Occurance of phases of moon

Phases of moon occur because of the revolution of moon around the earth. Half of the moon is always illuminated by the light of the sun. But that half is completely seen from the earth only on a full moon day. The part of the illuminated half of the moon, seen from the earth, changes daily due to its position. Thus, we can see various shapes or the phases of the moon.

Let us do Activity 14.4 to study how phase of moon occured.

Activity 14.4

You will need :- An electric bulb, a styrofoam ball fixed to a rod

Method:-

²² Use the electric bulb instead of the sun and the styrofoam ball fixed to a rod, instead of moon. This activity is to be done in a dark room.

SunEarthMoon

Figure 14.10 Demonstrating phases of moon

² Holding the styrofoam ball, turn around yourself and observe the illuminated part of the ball as in Figure 14.10.

14.4 Important incidents associated with solar system

Eclipses

Marvellous scenes that can be observed in the sky are eclipses. There are two types of eclipses.

²²Solar eclipses²²Lunar eclipses

Solar eclipses

The moon revolves around the earth once every 27.3 days. During this journey in some occasions the shadow of the moon falls on the earth. The sun is invisible, fully or partially, to those who are in the shadow area for some time. This is called the solar eclipse. We see the sun and the moon equal in size, in the sky. The sun is a very large object. Moon is very small with respect to the sun. But, the sun is very far away from the earth and the moon. That is why we see them more or less equal in size.

Because of this reason the moon can totally cover the sun during a solar eclipse. Two areas can be identified in the shadow of moon, fallen on the earth. These areas are the umbra and the penumbra. (Figure 14.13)

Annular solar eclipse

Sun

Moon

Umbra of moon covers an area of about 160 km2 of the earth. This area moves because of the rotation of earth. It means that the umbra travels along the surface of earth. The maximum time duration that a point of earth experiences a total solar eclipse is 7.5 minutes.

Solar eclipse occurs on new moon days.

An experience of a solar eclipse

Sri Lanka experienced a total solar eclipse on 20th June 1955. The eclipse commenced at 8.11 in the morning and after 7 minutes it was over at 8.18.

A person who experienced that solar eclipse described it as follows.

—That day the sun was shining in the morning as usual. After eight in the morning it began to fall dark. Birds flew to their nests. Fowls settle on trees. Environment get cooled. Sky darkened completely. Stars began to twinkle. But moon was not there as it was a new moon day.

After sometime it dawned again. Birds come out of their nests. Fowl got down from the trees. Cattle came out from their lying places.

Meteorological department announced in advance, that a solar eclipse occurs on that day. Therefore, it was declared a school holiday.˜

I never forget this incident.

Again in 15th of January 2010, Sri Lanka experienced an annular solar eclipse.

Science | Phenomena and exploration associated with solar system108

Observing solar eclipses

Solar eclipses should never be observed with naked eyes. Eye covers/goggles can be used for this purpose. Welders also use eye covers. Even using those aids, it is advisable not to watch the sun directly for a long time. If do not follow these instructions will result in the blindness of your eyes for ever.

It is safer to watch the image of the solar eclipse taken on to a screen using a mirror or a telescope.

Using gogglesTaking the image on to a screen using a telescopeFigure 14.15 Indicated below are some solar eclipses observable in future in Sri Lanka

December 26, 2019 - An annular eclipse

June 21, 2020 - An annular eclipseLunar eclipses

The number of lunar eclipses we can observe is more than the number of solar eclipses. Lunar eclipse occurs on a full moon day. Lunar eclipses occur when the earth comes in between the sun and the moon, and are in a straight line (Figure 14.16).

Total lunar eclipse occurs when moon enters completely into the umbra of the earth. This incident can be observed with your naked eyes. As a science student, it is very important for you to observe this. During a total lunar eclipse, moon can be observed in reddish brown colour. It lasts more than an hour (Figure 14.17).

Partial lunar eclipse

Instance in which a part of the moon is in the umbra of the earth and other part is in penumbra is called partial lunar eclipse. Here, the part of the moon in the umbra is seen in reddish brown colour (Figure 14.18).

Partial lunar eclipse occurs

14.5 Exploring the universe

Air cover around the earth is called the atmosphere. The atmosphere extends up to about 500 km from the surface of the earth. But it becomes very thin after about 100 km. The area that starts about 100 km far from the earth is termed as the space.

Since ancient times man has been exploring the space. However, the limits of the space, what it contains and how much does it contain such things are the questions man has not been able to find complete answers so far. The objective of science is to find out answers to such questions.

Initially man could reach the higher levels of atmosphere using balloons. Balloons filled with gases like hydrogen or helium which are lighter than air, can rise up into the sky. Balloons filled with hot air also rise up. Both of those can take man higher levels in the sky.

A balloon filled with hydrogen or heliumA balloon filled with hot airFigure 14.22

Science | Phenomena and exploration associated with solar system112

Usage of rockets

Later man realised that the only way to reach the outer space is by using rockets. Tsiolkovsky, a Russian and Goddard, an American were the pioneers to work on rockets.

Assignment 14.1

Find the facts about the work done by Tsiolkovsky and Goddard on rockets and make a report.

Let us do Activity 14.6 to make a simple rocket and to study how it works.

Activity 14.6

You will need :- Megabottle of 1.5 l, a rubber stopper, a valve of a bicycle tube, an inflater, waterMethod:-

Figure 14.23 Water rocket

yyBore a hole in the rubber stopper and fix the bicycle valve to it.

yyFill water up to 1/3 of the bottle and fix the rubber stopper with valve to it.

yyPlace the bottle with water as shown in the figure. Then, pump air into it using the inflater.

yyObserve the reaction.

While inflating at a certain moment the bottle with water unplugs and rise up in the air as a rocket.

This water rocket can be modified to rise higher up in the sky.

Science | Phenomena and exploration associated with solar system 113

Figure 14.24 A modified water rocketFigure 14.25 A student preparing to fly up a water rocket

You can obtain more details about water rockets from the Arthur C. Clerke center at Moratuwa. National and international competitions on sending water rockets are also being organised.

The first rocket which used liquid fuel was launched in 1926. The simplest rocket consists of a combustion chamber, a fuel tank, a liquid oxgen tank and a tank containing igniter.

Figure 14.26 A sketch of a liquid fuel rocket

Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (as fuel) and petrol (as igniter) are well mixed and pumped into the combustion chamber. Gases produced by the combustion were pushed down speedily through the nozzle, giving the rocket an upward force. This makes the rocket rise up into the sky.

Rising up of a rocket can be compared with the rising of the fire work called skyer.

Science | Phenomena and exploration associated with solar system114

14.6 Artificial satellites

The moon is attracted by the earth but moon does not fall on to the earth because it revolves speedily around the earth. Celestial bodies, smaller than the moon, which are orbiting the earth are called satellites.

Figure 14.27 The artificial satellite (Sputnik -1)

An object launched to revolve around the earth, using a rocket is known as an artificial satellite. The first artificial satellite named Sputnik-1 which was launched by Soviet union on October 4th, 1957. With this historical victory man entered into the space age (Figure 14.27).

The first American artificial satellite was Explorer-1 launched on January 31st, 1958.

NASA was established in 1958 to carry out the American space programme.

Assignment 14.2

Make a booklet on the uses obtained by artificial satellites.

Observe the sky in a clear night between 7.00 pm and 8.00 pm. If you see a star-like object moving through the stars, it is a satellite. If you see a falling of star like object it may be a meteor. Communication satellites

World's first commercial communication satellite was launched on July 10th, 1962. It was the Telstar-1. Until today, there are thousands of communication satellites orbited around the earth to provide telephone, television and web facilities.

Sir Arther C. Clerke came out with a new idea on communication by satellites. He said that if a satellite is orbited around the earth at the same speed as the speed of earth's rotation and at a certain height, it will be seen stationary from the earth. Such a satellite is called a Geo-stationary satellite. Sir Arther C. Clerke clarified that if three of such satellites are positioned around the earth, the whole globe can be covered with communication facilities.

Science | Phenomena and exploration associated with solar system 115

Figure 14.28 Geo - Stationary satellite network

Now the world is converted to "a global village" by the orbited geo-stationary satellites using the idea presented by Sir Arther C. Clerke in 1945.

Assignment 14.3

Prepare a booklet on the recent victories of space explorations.

14.7 Constellations

Ancient people who were watching stars in the night sky, imagined various star patterns by joining them.

Those ancient star patterns identified earlier and those named recently are called constellations. There are 88 constallations identified so far. Let us learn about a few of them.

It is important to identify the directions when observing the stars in the night sky. In the day time, directions can be found, using the direction of sun rise. Stretch your hands apart, and stand facing the direction of sun rise. Then, the front side is the east and back side is the west. Your right hand side is the south and left hand side is the north.

The buildings and tall trees can be used to find the directions at night, when you are watching night sky. The directions you identify in the day time will help you in this regard.

In the night sky, we see all the stars other than one star, apparently move from east to the west. But, actually what happens is that the earth rotates from west to the east. The star that does not change the position is the Polaris.

The position of Polaris does not change because it is located in line with the axis of the earth.

Science | Phenomena and exploration associated with solar system 119

Figure 14.31

Orion or the hunter is a very popular constellation. Here, the head of the hunter is directed towards the north. So, it is useful to find north at night.

We see that all the stars in a constellation are in the same plane. But, the distance to each star from the earth are greatly varing.

The unit used to measure the distance between stars is light year. Light travels 300 000 km per second. Light year is the distance that light travels during a year.

The constellation Orion, and the distances to some stars of it from the earth are given in Figure 14.32.

Light years 1000Figure 14.32 Constellation orion and the position of some of its stars

The constellation Orion is given with many other names.

Assignment 14.4

Find out the other names given for the constellation Orion.

Constellation Canis major can be found close by to Orion. The brightest star in the night sky, Sirius is found in this.

Figure 14.33

Sirius

When you are learning about constellations it is not sufficient to study the diagrams in this book. It is essential to observe night sky for constellations. The book is only a guide line for that purpose (Figure 14.33).

Figure 14.34

If you observe towards north-east from Orion, another constellation, Gemini can be found. It denotes twins. The brightest star in it is Pollux (Figure 14.34).

Figure 14.35

Obervation of stars and planets

When the night sky is being observed it is realised that the relative position of stars does not change daily or monthly. But, there are some objects among the constellations in the zodiac the position of which changes with respect to the stars. Those objects are planets.

There are five planets which are observable with the naked eyes. They are mercury, venus, mars, jupiter and saturn. Mercury, venus, earth and mars are planets in solid nature and other planets occur in gaseous nature.

A star twinkles in the sky. But planets do not twinkle. Star is a bright point, even when observed through a telescope. But, when a planet is observed through a telescope it is seen as a disc.

Some examples for natural disasters are drought, landslide, flood, lightning, forest fire, cyclone, earthquake, tsunami, tornado and glacier erosion. The way that natural disasters occur and their influence differ from region to region, and from country to country.

Reasons for the occurance of natural disasters are the weather and climatic changes, changes occuring at the interior of the earth and the changes occuring in the biosphere. Human activities affect to increase the intensity of natural disasters.

Activity 15.1

Make a collection of news paper head lines written on natural disasters.With referring to the collection, prepare a list of natural disasters occuring all over the world.

Some of the natural disasters that affect Sri Lanka are mentioned below.

²²Drought²²Landslide²²Flood²²Lightning and thundering

We will study about them in this lesson.

15.1 Drought

Long term decrease of rain fall, due to the change of the pattern of rain fall is known as drought. Way of definition and the nature of identification may change from country to country, region to region and from time to time.

Decrease of the amount of rain fall during a given time period, and as well as the change of the rain fall pattern cause droughts.

Thus, the reasons that affect the pattern of rain fall, affect the drought also.

Science | Natural disasters130

Let us do Assignment 15.1 to study the change of pattern of rain fall.

Assignment 15.1

Find the data of rain fall in Sri Lanka for past few years. Comparing those values, study the rain fall pattern. Data can be collected from the meteorological department or from internet. Ask the assistance of your teacher for this.

Reasons for drought

Natural reasons as well as human activities may affect this. Natural reasons cause to change rain fall pattern and the amount of rain fall. Some natural reasons for drought are mentioned below.

yy Lack of timely monsoon winds

yy Dry air currents

yy The phenomenon of EL-NINO

As Sri lanka is an island, wind pattern basically affects the rain fall. Study the Table 15.1 given below.

Table 15.1 - Methods that bring rain fall to Sri LankaMethod of rain fallTime periodRegion / ZoneSouth - West monsoonMay - SeptemberWet zoneNorth - East monsoonNovember - FebruaryDry zoneConvectional / Intermonsoonal rain

March - April September - October

All regions

Dry air currents increase the rate of transpiration in plants. It increases the absorption of ground water by the roots of plants. Fountains dry up due to the reduction of ground water. This condition may cause a drought.

El-NINO is a phenomenon caused by the increase of temperature of the surface water in Pacific ocean. With the increase of the temperature of surface water in the ocean, normal circulation pattern of global air currents and oceanic water currents or the streams change.

Science | Natural disasters 131

Figure 15.3 Wind pattern

Influence of the EL-NINO phenomenon may cause droughts as well as rain in Sri Lanka.

Drying up of water sources, decrease of water retention capacity in soil and global warming are the results of some human activities. These activities may cause the occurance or further intensifying of droughts.

Some human activities that may cause drought are mentioned below.

yy Seepage of rain water into soil decreases due to various constructions. This

decreases the water retention capacity in the soil. Water sources dry out because of deforestation for construction work.

yy Wastage of water by irregular and over use is a reason for drought.

yy Decrease of water retention capacity in soil and accelerated soil erosion are

the results of irregular cultivation of crops. Thus, water capacity of reservoirs decrease, resulting spillage.

yy Deforestation influences the water cycle directly or indireclty. Convectional

rains and rain fall are affected by this.

yy Global warming also change the pattern of rain fall. Gases like carbon dioxide

released into the atmosphere due to human activities, leads to global warming. Such gases are known as greenhouse gases.

How droughts occur due to human activities and natural causes can be simply shown by Figure 15.4.

Drought disaster management

There are three main steps that should be followed when managing any disaster.

yy Readiness to face the disaster

yy Mitigation of the damages caused by the disaster

yy Adaptation to live with the disaster

Droughts are unavoidable. In the process of disaster management, readiness to face the disaster, mitigation and adaptation can be followed to minimize the damage caused by the disaster.

Some of the measures that can be taken in drought disaster management are given below.

yy Avoiding the wastage and pollution of water - Rules and regulations should be

introduced and people should be made aware of using water economically and without polluting.

yy Planning agricultural activities with the view of conservation of water.

- Practising economic water supply methods

Figure 15.6 Drought resistant corn plants

- Cultivating drought resistant crops

- Mulching

yy Improving methods of collecting rain water.

yy Reforestation - Growing forests in lieu of cleared

forests

yy Usage of alternatives to hydropower for the

generation of power.

e.g.:- Wind power, solar power etc.

Science | Natural disasters134

15.2 Floods

Inundation of a usually uninundating area, due to heavy rain fall in a short period of time is known as a flood.

According to the way of occurance, they can be categorised as below.

²²Floods due to over - flowing - These floods occur due to the over flowing of rivers and other water ways.

²²Instantaneous floods - This situation occurs due to the blockage of water drainage systems in urban areasReasons for floods

²² High rain fall²² Blockage of water drainage systems²² Removal of forest cover²² Irregular land use²² Reduction of the capacity of reservoirs²² Irregular land filling²² Irregular construction work

Influences due to floods

²²Loss of lives

²²Failure of power supply, transportation and public services

²²Damage to houses, property and roads

²²Spread of communicable diseases after floods due to contamination of water sources

Management of flood disaster

²²Refraining from putting up houses in flood areas. If it is necessary to put up a house in such a place, it is advisable to build it on pillars'

²²Leaving partially inundated houses as it is dangerous to stay in them.

²²Disconnecting the electricity supply of the houses and refraining from touching electrical items while being in water.

²²Having identified a place and a method to keep goods securely during a flood.

²²Having identified an elevated place to reach for security.

²²Having prepared a disaster kit, contains drinking water, dry food stuffs and other essential items to take in the case of leaving home.

²²Having prepared with a battery-powered radio.

Science | Natural disasters 135

²²Refraining from walking through fast-flowing water. One can be pushed down by running water of the depth of six inches (15 cm).

²²Refraining from driving motor vehicles across flooded area. Leaving the vehicle and reach a higher land, if the vehicle is drowned.

15.3 Landslide / Earth slip

Slipping down of soil layers in slopy

Figure 15.8 A location of landslide

regions in highlands can be considered as a landslide.

Landslides are a common disaster in central hills of Sri Lanka. Places of landslide danger are identified in some other districts, also. Those areas are in Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Mathale, Kandy, Kegalle, Monaragala, Kurunegala, Rathnapura, Kaluthara, Galle, Mathara and Hambanthota districts. Such areas are shown in Figure 15.9.

What is happening during a landslide is the slipping down of a lump of soil or a

layer of soil upon another layer under gravity.

Continuous heavy rain causes landslides in risky regions.

Figure 15.9 Regions which are subjected to the danger of landslides in Sri Lanka

Soil, soaked in rain water becomes heavy. The bond between soil particles and the bed rock getting weak at the same time. Due to the weaken bond, there is a point that the bed rock can not hold the upper soil layer further. At that moment soil particles start to flow down suddenly and soil particles near by the activity region join with the flow.

Gravitational potentional energy of the lumps of soil increases because of being in a higher elevation and absorption of water. This high potential energy is converted to kinetic energy while the layers of soil are slipping down. Because of this kinetic energy, lumps of soil and rocks collect everything in the route while flowing down. Sometimes the route of a landslide may be as long as 1 km.

Pre-signs of a landslide

If the following incidents are occuring with continuous heavy rainfall, it indicates a close-by landslide.

²²Receiving more than 100 mm of rainfall within 24 hours

²²Appearing new cracks on the surface of the slope

²²Appearing cracks on buildings

²²Depressions on earth

²²Dying or slanting of trees on slopes

²²Sudden leaking of muddy water on slopes

²²Sudden surface run-off of water or disappearing of springs

²²Animals showing abnormal behaviours

²²Appearing new water springs

²²Entering water into cracks of the earth and oozing out from some other places with mud

Management of landslides

²²Removing the slide initiation area (slide initiation has a large rock or a thick layer of soil, under which there is an area of water or mud. That is the first place to collapse with a heavy noise during a landslide). Removing of slide initiation area is very difficult as it is not easy to reach the place. To avoid the destruction caused by landslide, the slide should be removed using cranes. This should be done by the relevant authorities.

²²There are three main risk areas in a landslide namely initiation area, flow path and depositional area. Relevant authorities must be assigned power to take necessary measures to prevent landslides.

²²Evacuating people from the areas subjected to landslides earlier and let the areas be stabilized.

²²Bringing down water using pipe lines when it is collected in higher levels of a hill.

²²Diging conteur ditches to drain rain water down the slope without letting it soak into soil.

²²If a slope of a hill is necessary to cut, it should be cut in cascade manner. Water drainage systems should be prepared. Cover crops should be grown. e.g.:- Vetiver

Science | Natural disasters 137

²²Stability of the land should be considered, when selecting a land to build a house. It is not suitable to build houses in slopy areas by cutting the slope. A place of prior landslide is also not suitable for putting up houses.

If a construction is to be done in a district of landslide threats, consulting National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) is necessary. Pepole can get necessary directions from the regional offices of the soil organisation. The web address is www.nbro.gov.lk.

15.4 Lightning and thundering

There are tiny water droplets and ice

Figure 15.10 A cumulonimbus cloud and a lightning

crystals in cumulonimbus clouds. Because of air currents, those water droplets and ice crystals are rubbed each other. Thus, they become charged.

Positive charges collect in the top layers of the cloud and negative charges collect in the bottom layer of the cloud. Positive charges are generated on the earth, right below the cloud. When the amount of charges reach a certain level, an electrical discharge occurs. It is known as lightning and thundering.

According to the way of electrical discharge, there are three types of lightning (Figure 15.11).

²² Earth-lightning is an electrical

²² Cloud-lightning is an electrical

discharge that transfer through the cloud or between two clouds.

²² Air-lightning is an electrical

discharge that transfer from a cloud into the air.

Science | Natural disasters138

Let us do Activity 15.2 to study about the discharging of electrical charges.

Activity 15.2

You will need :- Two thin dry plastic stripsMethod:-

yyKeep two plastic strips, one over the other. Hold them from one end to hang down.

yyRub the two strips down firmly using your thumb and another finger.

yyObserve what happens.

yyTry this activity using strips of transparent sheets.

You can observe that the plastic strips shift apart at the lower ends. That is because the strips are electrically charged.

If you drag apart the strips, you can observe a sound.

For extra knowledge

Voltage of a lightning stroke is about 100 million Volts. Electrical energy generated in lightning is very high. Electrical current of a lightning is about 25, 000 amperes.

Current flowing through a bulb of 25 W is about 0.1 A and Voltage of house hold electrical supply is 230 V.

Lightning danger is common during the inter-monsoons in Sri Lanka. Maximum number of accidents due to lightning were reported during the month of April. Each year, more than 50 deaths are reported due to lightning.

(from science data)

Tall buildings and trees are easily subjected to the hazard of lightning. The reason for this is that tall places provide the shortest path for the discharge of lightning from the clouds.

Science | Natural disasters 139

Management of Lightning hazards

Destruction of buildings by lightning can be avoided

Figure 15.12 A building fitted with a lightning conductor

by fitting lightning conductors.

Lightning conductors should be fitted to the required standards. Some other protective measures from lightning are listed below.

²²Avoid keeping the house connected to close-by trees with metallic wires. Metallic cloth lines and wires used to the trees that are slanted to the houses are some examples for this.²²Conducting wires in the environment (electricity supply wires, television antenna wires, protective wires, wire fences) help to conduct electric current of a lightning from place to place. Therefore, protective measures should be taken, when fixing them.

It is appropriate to follow the measures indicated below, when a lightning weather condition is forecast.

²²Keeping the electrical appliances disconnected from the circuits.

²²Keeping the disconnected plug of television antenna out of the house, near the ground.

²²Refraining from using and touching metal equipments.

²²Refraining from using telephones.

The things that should be done before a lightning weather condition are mentioned below.

²²Going into a building or into a fully covered vehicle to minimize exposure to the environment.

²²Going to a place of security, if the time interval between sight and the sound of the lightning thunder is less than 15 seconds.

Things to avoid during a lightning weather condition

²²Avoid being in open places. If there is no time to go to a place of security, keep your legs close to each other and crouch to the ground.

²²Refraining of being near tall trees and elevated places.

²²Refraining from riding or driving open vehicles like cycles and tractors.

²²Refraining from swimming, canoeing and walking on wet places.

Science | Natural disasters140

Measures to be taken in connection with a person subjected to lightning hazard

All lightning hazards are not fatal. First aids should be given to a person subjected to such a threat.

If the limbs of the victim are numbed or stiffed, massaging can be done to recover.

If breathing is stopped, artificial breathing should be given. Both massaging and artificial breathing have to be given according to the nature of harm. Giving first aids should be continued till breathing starts.

It is not dangerous to touch a person subjected to a lightning hazard.
