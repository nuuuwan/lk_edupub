The King and The Monkey

Once there was a king, who had a pet monkey. It was treated royally and moved freely in the king’s palace. It was also allowed to enter the king’s personal rooms which were closed even for the most trustworthy servants.

One afternoon, the king was asleep and the monkey was in his room. All of a sudden a fly came into the room and sat on the king’s chest. The monkey swayed it away, but the fly returned back to the king’s chest. The monkey got very angry. It took the sword and started chasing the fly with it. When the fly sat on the king’s chest again, the monkey hit the fly with all his might. The fly flew away, but the king was severely wounded.
