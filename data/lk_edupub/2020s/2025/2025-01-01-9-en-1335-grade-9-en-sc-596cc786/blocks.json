    "text": "This textbook was compiled by the Educational Publications Department in accordance with the syllabus prepared by the National Institute of Education for the use of Grade 9 students in the Sri Lankan school system with effect from 2018.An effort has made here to arrange the subject content to suit the national educational goals, common national competencies, the objectives of teaching science and the content of the syllabus.The subject of science directs the student towards a more active learning process in a manner as to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes needed for a developmental scientific thought.In the compilation of this textbook, subject content is largely arranged based on experiences of daily life. It has contributed to prove the fact that the subject of science is very much closer to the day to day life.The compilation of this textbook based on activities is a distinctive feature. The activities are prepared based on the scientific method in order to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes. Activities that can be performed individually at home as well as in school are incorporated here. We believe that learning through activities would contribute to create a liking and an interest in the child towards learning science. At the end of each chapter, a summary, a series of exercises and a glossary were included. It enables the student to identify the important details of the chapter as well as to self evaluate the achievement of learning outcomes.For the purpose of directing the student to study further about the subject matter, more information is included in the \"For extra knowledge\". It is given only to broaden the subject area of the child and certainly not to ask questions at term tests.Assignments and projects are given with the purpose of directing the student towards an explorative study. It enables the students to develop the higher order skills such as application, analysis and synthesis of the concepts achieved from the lesson.We strongly believe that the duty of the teachers who teach science is to direct the student for self learning instead of teaching the student using traditional teaching methods. This textbook can be utilized by the teachers as a learning tool to execute their teaching role properly. We would like to bestow our sincere thanks on the professional writer Dr. K. Ariyasinghe.We kindly request you to forward your comments and suggestions on this textbook to the Educational Publications Department.",

Very often the luster of these objects is due to a metal layer deposited on them. In order to prevent rusting of the parts of motor vehicles, they are coated with a thin metallic layer by electroplating. Mostly metals like copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au), nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr) are plated like this. In such instances, the metal plate has a certain property which is lacking in the metal which is subjected to plating. Resistance to corrosion, attractive colour, luster and good finish are some of such properties.",

As the harvest that flourishes by absorbing nutrients from the soil of the cultivated land is removed from it, the soil becomes deficient in nutrients. Therefore, the soil should be supplied with nutrients from outside. It is done by applying fertilizers, containing artificially prepared minerals and artificially synthesized chemicals, which are being applied more and more. But, instead of this, organic fertilizers such as compost formed by subjecting plant or animal materials to natural processes can be applied. Some facts regarding the importance of the use of organic fertilizers rather than inorganic fertilizers can be listed as follows.",

Fertilizers can be produced ourselves using refuse such as straw, plant debris, chaff and saw dust. \u00b2There is a greater demand for rice, vegetables, fruits and leafy vegetables obtained from organic farming among the discerning people in Sri Lanka.

    "text": "Lightning and thunder The voltage of a cloud to ground lightning is about 10 million volts. In such a lightning a current of nearly 25 000 amperes flows. The voltage of an LED lamp used in houses is 230 volts while the current flowing through it is less than even 0.1 amperes. Hence, you will be able to understand how high is the voltage and current of a lightning. When such a large current flows through air in a very short time (about 10 milliseconds), air is heated up to a very high temperature. This temperature is about 30 000 0C. It is five times the temperature of the sun's surface. Due to the high air temperature, around the lightning current expands instantaneously (same thing happens when a cracker explodes). When air expands at once like this, first a wave is generated followed by a sound wave. The result of the sound wave is the thunder. In lightning, both light and sound are born simultaneously. But, light is seen first and sound is heard afterwards. The reason for this is that the speed of light is very high whereas the speed of sound is much less than the speed of light. Since the speed of light is very high, light travel from the place where lightning occurs to us is negligibly small. Sound takes more time to reach us. That is why sound reaches us later.",

    "text": "\u00b2Lightning is a natural disaster affecting Sri Lanka. It causes loss of human lives, animal lives and property. \u00b2 Lightning occurs mainly due to the accumulation of electrostatic charges in cumulonimbus clouds. \u00b2 When the clouds heavily laden with electric charges they get discharged. \u00b2 Lightnings are classified according to the way of discharge. \u00b2Cloud of ground lightnings are the most harmful. They are further classified according to how they get earthed. \u00b2 In a lightning bolt, flow of a high current occurs instantaneously due to the high potential difference created between the clouds and the Earth. \u00b2 Thunder is the result of sudden expansion of air due to intense heat generated in an electric discharge. \u00b2 In a lightning through both light and thunder are produced simultaneously, an observer at a distance sees light first and hears the sound afterwards. \u00b2 The damage caused by lightning can be minimized by suitable precautions and following safety measures in the occasions of lightning.",
