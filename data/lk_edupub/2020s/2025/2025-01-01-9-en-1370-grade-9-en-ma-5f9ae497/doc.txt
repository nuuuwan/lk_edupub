Number Patterns1

By studying this lesson you will be able to;² develop the general term of a number pattern with the same difference between

adjacent terms,² develop the number pattern when the general term is known,² solve problems associated with number patterns.

Introduction to number patterns

Several number patterns are given below.

i. 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, ...

ii. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...

iii. 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, ...

iv. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...

v. 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, ...

vi. 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, ...

The first number pattern is very simple. Every number of this number pattern is 3.While the first number of the second number pattern is 2, all the numbers thereafter are obtained by adding 2 to the previous number.

While the first number of the third number pattern is 5, all the numbers thereafter are obtained by adding 3 to the previous number.

While the first number of the fourth number pattern is 2, all the numbers thereafter are obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2.

The fifth and sixth number patterns have characteristics which are inherent to them.

The numbers of a number pattern are called “terms”.

For example, each term of the first number pattern is 3.

Introduction to number patterns

2 for free distribution

The first term of the second number pattern is 2, the second term is 4, the third term is 6, etc. In this pattern, each term which comes after the first term is obtained by adding 2 to the previous term.

The first term of the third number pattern is 5, the second term is 8, the third term is 11, etc. In this pattern, each term which comes after the first term is obtained by adding 3 to the previous term.

In the fourth number pattern, each term which comes after the first term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.

The ways in which the terms of the fifth and sixth number patterns are obtained can also be described as above. However, the descriptions will be more complicated.

Observe that the terms of the number patterns given above are separated by commas and that there are three dots (ellipsis) at the end of each number pattern. This is how number patterns are usually written. The three dots indicate that the number pattern continues.

In mathematics, the word “sequence” is used for the word “pattern”. Accordingly, six “number sequences” (or simply “sequences”) are given above. The order of the terms of a sequence is important.

For example, although the sequence 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, ... and the sequence 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, ... consist of the same numbers, they are two different sequences.

In the above examples of sequences, only a few initial terms are given. However, it is incorrect to presume the pattern of the sequence by considering only a few initial terms.For example,

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...

is a number pattern; that is, a sequence. If only the first five terms of the sequence are given (that is, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …), and a person is asked what the next term is, one may be provided with the incorrect answer 6. Hence, asking for the next term (or next few terms) after giving only the first few terms of a sequence is mathematically incorrect.

A method of describing a sequence accurately is by providing a rule by which each term of the sequence can be calculated.

3 for free distribution

The uniqueness (or characteristic) of the second and third sequences of the six sequences given above can be explained as follows.

In the second sequence, every term which comes after the first term is obtained by adding the constant value 2 to the previous term. This can be illustrated as follows.

2

+2

46810

+2+2+2

In the third sequence, every term which comes after the first term is obtained by adding the constant value 3 to the previous term. This can be illustrated as follows.

5

+3

8111417

+3+3+3

Here, the meaning of “constant value” is “the value remains unchanged”.

The characteristic which is common to both these patterns can be described as follows.

“The value obtained by subtracting the previous term from any term (except the first term) is a constant (that is, a constant value).”

The value of this constant is 2 for the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, …(since 4 − 2 = 6 − 4 = 8 − 6 = 10 − 8 = 2).

The value of this constant is 3 for the sequence 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, …(since 8 − 5 = 11 − 8 = 14 − 11 = 17 − 14 = 3).

Let us study further about sequences of which the difference between every pair of consecutive terms is a constant value.

This constant value is known as the common difference of the sequence. Accordingly,

common difference = any term except the first term – the previous term

4 for free distribution

It can be seen that the first sequence 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, … also has the same characteristic.

3

+0

3333

+0+0+0

Here, the constant value added (that is the common difference) is 0.

Another sequence with the same characteristic is given below.

17

−5

1272− 3...

−5−5−5

The first term of this sequence is 17. Every term which comes thereafter is obtained by subtracting 5 from the previous term. That is, by adding −5 to the previous term. Accordingly, the common difference of this sequence is −5.

Common difference = 12 − 17 = 7 − 12 = 2 − 7 = −3 − 2 = −5.

If the value of the common difference and the first term of a sequence with a common difference are known, the first few terms of the sequence can be written easily. A couple of examples of such sequences are given below.

Example 1

The first three terms of the sequence with first term 4 and common difference 3 are 4, 7 and 10.

Example 2

The first five terms of the sequence with first term 7 and common difference − 4 are 7, 3. −1, −5 and −9.

The first few terms of a sequence with a common difference can be written easily, when the first term and common difference are given. But it is not so easy to find, say the 50th term or the 834th term. The reason is because 50 and 834 are fairly large numbers. It is important to know the general term of a sequence to be able to find any term of the sequence easily. Now let us see what is meant by the general term.

5 for free distribution

The general term of a number pattern

First, let us introduce a specific notation to denote the terms of a sequence. For a given sequence, let us denote

the first term by T1,the second term by T2,the third term by T3, etc.

For example, with regard to the sequence

5, 11, 17, 23, ...

we can indicate the terms as follows:

the first term, T1 = 5the second term, T2 = 11the third term, T3 = 17the fourth term, T4 = 23

It is very important to consider the nth term of a sequence, as is usually done in mathematics. Here, n represents any positive integer. The reason for this is that the values n can assume are positive integers such as 1, 2, 3, ... . The 1

2 th term, the −4th term, the 3.5th term, etc., have no meaning. When considering a value n, the corresponding nth term is denoted by Tn. This is called the general term of the sequence. Accordingly,

the general term (nth term) of a sequence is denoted by Tn.

1.1 Developing the number sequence when the general term is given

In the previous section we learnt the notation that is used to denote the terms of a sequence, in particular, the general term. Now, through a couple of examples, let us consider how to develop the number sequence and how to find a named term of the sequence, when the general term is given.

The general term of a number pattern

1.1 Developing the number sequence when the general term is given

6 for free distribution

Example 1 Consider the number sequence with general term Tn = 2n + 3.

(i) Write the first three terms of this sequence.(ii) Find the 20th term. (iii) Which term is equal to 123?(iv) Find the (n + 1)th term in terms of n.

(i) Since the general term Tn = 2n + 3,when n = 1; the first term T1= (2 × 1) + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5,when n = 2; the second term T2 = (2 × 2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7,when n = 3; the third term T3 = (2 × 3) + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9.

Therefore, the first three terms of this number pattern are 5, 7, 9.

(ii) The 20th term is obtained by substituting n = 20 in 2n + 3.

The 20th term, T20 = (2 × 20) + 3 = 40 + 3

= 43Therefore, the 20th term is 43.

(iii) Let us assume that the nth term is 123.

Then, 2n + 3 = 123

2n + 3 – 3 = 123 – 3

2n = 120

n = 2

120

= 60Therefore, 123 is the 60th term of the number pattern.

(iv) In order to obtain the (n + 1)th term, let us substitute (n + 1) for n.The (n + 1)th term,

Tn + 1 = 2 (n + 1) + 3

= 2n + 2 + 3= 2n + 5Therefore, the (n + 1)th term, in terms of n, is 2n + 5.

7 for free distribution

Example 2 Consider the number pattern with general term Tn = 56 – 4n.

(i) Write the first three terms of this number pattern.(ii) Find the 12th term.(iii) Show that 0 is a term of this number pattern.(iv) Show that 18 is not a term of this number pattern.

(i) Since the general term Tn = 56 – 4n,

when n = 1; the first term T1 = 56 – (4 × 1) = 56 – 4 = 52when n = 2; the second term T2 = 56 – (4 × 2) = 56 – 8 = 48when n = 3; the third term T3 = 56 – (4 × 3) = 56 – 12 = 44Therefore, the first three terms of the number pattern are 52, 48, 44.

(ii)The 12th term = 56 – 4 × 12

= 56 – 48= 8

(iii) If 0 is a term of the number pattern, then for some integer n, we have

56 – 4n = 0. ∴ 56 – 4n + 4n = 4n (adding 4n to both sides)

456 = 4

4n

14 = n

n = 14 The 14th term of the number pattern is 0.Therefore 0 is a term of this number pattern.

(iv) If 18 is a term of this number pattern, then for some integer n, we have

56 – 4n = 18. Then, 56 – 4n + 4n = 18 + 4n

56 – 18 = 18 – 18 + 4n

38 = 4n

9 2

1 = n

If 18 is a term of this number pattern, the value of n should be a whole number. Since n = 9 2

1 , 18 is not a term of this number pattern.

1.2 Obtaining an expression for the general term (Tn)

In the previous section an expression was given for the general term Tn. Our objective in this section, is to obtain an expression for Tn in terms of n. Then, any term of the sequence can easily be found by using the obtained expression. Now let us consider how we can develop such an expression, through an example. Suppose we want to find the 80th term of the sequence 5, 11, 17, 23…, which is a sequence with a common difference. That is, we want to find the value of T80. First, examine the pattern given in the following table.

nTn

How Tn can be written in terms of n and

the common difference 6.12345

511172329

6 × 1 − 1 or 5 + 0 × 6 6 × 2 − 1 or 5 + 1× 6 6 × 3 − 1 or 5 + 2 × 66 × 4 − 1 or 5 + 3 × 6 6 × 5 − 1 or 5 + 4 × 6

You may be wondering why the expressions 6 × 1 − 1, 6 × 2 − 1, 6 × 3 – 1, etc., given in the 3rd column of the table have been written. Especially, the reason why 1 is subtracted from each term may be unclear to you. This can be explained as follows.

Since the common difference of the given sequence 5, 11, 17, 23, … is 6, let us write the given sequence first and several multiples of 6 below it.

5, 11, 17, 23, 29, ...6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ...

It is clear that the given sequence can be obtained by subtracting 1 from each multiple of 6.

That is,

the first term of the sequence = the first multiple of 6 – 1the second term of the sequence = the second multiple of 6 –1

the third term of the sequence = the third multiple of 6 – 1

Accordingly, the nth term of the sequence = the nth multiple of 6 – 1

∴ Tn = 6n − 1

1.2 Obtaining an expression for the general term (Tn)

10 for free distribution

Accordingly,

T80 = 6 × 80 − 1 = 479.

Therefore, the 80th term is 479.

Moreover, an expression for the general term Tn of this sequence was found above as Tn = 6n − 1.We can find any term of the sequence using this expression. For example, in order to find the 24th term of this sequence, n has to be substituted with 24.

T24 = 6 × 24 −1 = 143

Therefore, the 24th term of the sequence is 143.

Let us consider another example.

Example 1

Given that the sequence with first four terms15, 19, 23, 27 has a common difference, let us find an expression for the nth term.

The common difference = 19 − 15 = 4' Let us write the first few terms of the given sequence, and several multiples (positive integer multiples) of 4 below them.

15, 19, 23, 27, ...

4, 8, 12, 16, ...It is clear that the given number pattern is obtained by adding 11 to each multiple of 4.

Therefore, the expression for the general term Tn is given by Tn = 4n + 11. Let us find the 100th term using this expression.

T100 = 4 × 100 + 11 = 411

Now let us consider a sequence with a negative common difference, which therefore consists of terms which are decreasing in value.

Example 2 Let us find an expression for the general term Tn of the sequence with a common difference, of which the first four terms are 10, 7, 4, 1.

The common difference of the sequence 10, 7, 4, 1, … = 7 − 10 = − 3.

11 for free distribution

Therefore, let us write the first few terms of the given sequence and a few multiples of −3 (integral), one below the other.

10, 7, 4, ...− 3, − 6, − 9, ...

It can be seen that the terms of the sequence are obtained by adding 13 to the multiples of −3. Therefore, the general term can be written as

Tn = − 3n + 13

(Or else, it can be written as Tn = 13 − 3n with the positive term first.)

For example, in order to find the 30th term, n = 30 should be substituted in the expression for Tn.

T30 = − 3 × 30 + 13 = − 77

Therefore, the 30th term is − 77.

All sequences in this exercise have a common difference.

1.3 Solving mathematical problems involving number patterns

We can solve various mathematical problems by developing number patterns using information that is given.

Example 1 A long distance runner trains every day. On the first day he runs 500 m and on each day thereafter he runs 100 m more than on the previous day.

i. Write separately the distances he runs on the first three days.ii. Find the general term Tn for the distance he runs on the nth day, in terms of n.iii. Find the distance he runs on the 20th day.iv. On which day does he run 3km?

i. The distance run on the first day = 500 mThe distance run on the second day = 500 m + 100 m = 600 m

The distance run on the third day = 500 m + 100 m + 100 m = 700 m∴ The first three terms of the number pattern are 500, 600, 700

1.3 Solving mathematical problems involving number patterns

ii. Let us take the day as n.

The number pattern of the distance run by the athlete is built up by multiples of 100.Therefore, the general term Tn = 100n + 400

iii. It is clear that the distance run on the 20th day is represented by the 20th term.

The 20th term, T20 = (100 × 20) + 400

= 2000 + 400= 2400 m= 2.4 km

∴ The distance run on the 20th day is 2.4 km.iv. Let us assume that 3000 m are run on the nth day.

Then, 100n + 400 = 3000100n + 400 – 400 = 3000 – 400

100 n = 2600

∴ n = 100

2600

= 26Therefore, 3km are run on the 26th day.

Exercise 1.3

1. A pattern created by using matchsticks is shown below.

i. Find the number of matchsticks needed to create the 20th figure.ii. 219 matchsticks are required to create which figure of this pattern?iii. Show that one matchstick remains after creating a figure of this pattern by

using the maximum number of match sticks from 75 matchsticks.

Introduction

Let us recall how numbers are written in the Hindu - Arabic number system, which is the number system we use.

As an example, let us consider the number 3 725. According to what we have learnt in previous grades,

5 denotes the number of 1s (that is, the number of 100s),

2 denotes the number of 10s (that is, the number of 101s),

7 denotes the number of 100s (that is, the number of 102s),

3 denotes the number of 1000s (that is, the number of 103s).

The above can be represented on an abacus as shown below.

1000 100 10 1

103102101100

Observe that the number 3 725 can also be written in terms of powers of 10 as shown below. 3 725 = 3 × 1000 + 7 × 100 + 2 × 10 + 5 × 1

That is, 3 725 = 3 ×103 + 7 × 10 2 + 2 ×101 + 5 × 10

0

17 for free distribution

If we consider 603 as another example, we can write it as shown below.

603 = 6 × 10 2 + 0 × 10 1 + 3 × 10 0

In the Hindu - Arabic number system which we use, the place values are powers of ten such as 1, 10, 100 and 1000. Moreover, we use the 10 digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 to write numbers in the Hindu - Arabic number system. The method of writing numbers using these 10 digits and assigning place values which are powers of ten, is called writing the numbers in “base 10”. When studying about number bases, these numbers are called “decimal numbers”.

Note : 10

0 = 1. Similarly, any nonzero base raised to the power zero is always equal to one. Accordingly, 20 = 1.

2.1 Expressing numbers in the binary number system

We can use number bases other than base ten to express numbers. For example, we can express numbers in “base two” by using only the digits 0 and 1, and assigning place values which are powers of two. To do this, let us first identify several powers of two. We can write them as;

2

0 = 1 25 = 32 21 = 2 26 = 64 22 = 4 27 = 128 23 = 8 28 = 256 24 = 16 29 = 512

To understand the method of writing numbers in base two, let us first consider the base ten number 13 as an example. Let us see how we can write 13 as a sum of powers of two. The first few powers of two are;

1, 2, 4 and 8.Using these numbers which are powers of two, we can write,

13 = 8 + 4 + 1

i.e., 13 = 23 + 22 + 20

i.e., 13 = 1 × 23 + 1 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 1 × 20.

18 for free distribution

Here, we have written all the non - negative powers of two in descending order, starting from 23 and continuing with 22, 21 and 20. Also, since the power 23 is included, it is written as 1 × 23 and since the power 21 is not included, it is written as 0 × 21. Recall that we use only the digits 1 and 0 when writing base two numbers. Considering the above facts, we can write 13 as a base two number as follows. 1101The digits 0 and 1 appearing in this base two number can be described as follows.

1 1 0 1

2322 2120

We can also express it using an abacus as follows.

23 22 21 2

0

1101

To indicate that 1101 is a base two number, we usually write “two” as a subscript and express the number as 1101two. In this lesson, whenever necessary, we indicate base ten numbers with the subscript “ten” to differentiate the base two numbers from the base ten numbers. For example, the decimal number 603 is written as 603ten.

Let us consider another example. Let us write the base ten number 20 ten as a base two number.

By recalling the powers of two, we can write;

20 = 16 + 4 = 24 + 22 = 1 × 24 + 0 × 23 + 1 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 0 × 20. Hence, 20ten = 10100two.

There is an important fact to remember here. There is only one way of writing any number as a sum of distinct descending powers of two. For example, 20 = 16 + 4 can only be written as 24 + 22 as a sum of distinct descending powers of two. There is no other way. You can see this for yourself by attempting to find a different way. Moreover, any number can be written as a sum of powers of two. You can verify this too by writing different decimal numbers as a sum of distinct powers of two.

19 for free distribution

The above method of writing a decimal number as a sum of distinct descending powers of two, cannot be considered as a precise method. The reason for this is because it is difficult to decide what powers of two add up to a number, when the number is large. For example, it is not easy to determine the powers of two that add up to the decimal number 3905ten.

Therefore, let us now consider another method that can be used to convert any decimal number to a binary number fairly easily.

Consider 22ten as an example. To write this as a binary number, we need to first divide 22 by 2 and write the remainder also.

222

11 remainder 0

Next we need to divide the quotient 11 which we obtained by dividing 22 by 2, again by 2.

2222 11 remainder 0

5 remainder 1

We need to continue dividing the quotient by 2 and noting down the remainder, until we get 0 as the quotient and 1 as the remainder. The complete division is shown below.

1 0 1 1 0 two

2222222

11 remainder 05 remainder 12 remainder 11 remainder 00 remainder 1

When the highlighted remainders are written from bottom to top, we obtain the required base two number.

22ten = 10110twoLet us see whether we can verify this answer using the method we discussed earlier of writing the number as a sum of powers of two.

22 = 16 + 4 + 2 = 24 + 22 + 21 = 1 × 24 + 0 × 23 + 1 × 22 + 1 × 21 + 0 × 20

= 10110twoThe answer is verified.

2.2 Converting binary numbers into decimal numbers

Decimal numbers were converted into binary numbers in the above section 2.1. In this section we consider the inverse process; that is, converting binary numbers into decimal numbers. This can be done fairly easily. Let us learn how to do this by considering an example.

In section 2.1, when we wrote the decimal number 13 as a binary number, we obtained 1101two. Let us recall what the digits 1, 1, 0 and 1 represent. 1 1 0 1

number

of 23s

number

of 22s

number

of 21s

number

of 20s

Therefore, by adding all the values of the powers of two in 1101two we get the corresponding decimal representation.

1 × 23 + 1 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 1 × 20 = 1 × 8 + 1 × 4 + 0 × 2 + 1 × 1

= 8 + 4 + 1 = 13.

21 for free distribution

By simplifying, we obtain the corresponding decimal number 13.

Example 1

Write 101100two as a decimal number.

First, it should be noted that the place value of the leftmost digit of this base two number is 25 and that the other place values are obtained by reducing the index by one (starting from 5) for each move from left to right. Then the required decimal number can be found by multiplying each power of two (place value) by the relevant co-efficient and adding all the terms together.

101100two= 1× 25 + 0 × 24 + 1 × 23 + 1 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 0 × 20

= 25 + 23 + 22 = 32 + 8 + 4

= 44ten

Therefore, when 101100twois written in base 10 we obtain 44ten.

Note: This answer can be verified by converting 44ten back into a binary number.

2.3 Adding binary numbers

When representing binary numbers on an abacus, the maximum number of counters that can be placed on a rod is 1. Moreover, instead of placing two counters on a rod, we always place one counter on the rod to the left of it.

Let us learn how to add binary numbers with the aid of two abacuses.

Let us simplify 101two+ 10two .

22 21 20 + 22 21 20

= 22 21 20

101two 10two 111two

A B C

22 for free distribution

Let us represent the sum of the numbers represented on the abacuses A and B on the abacus C. When we consider the two abacuses A and B;

the sum of the counters on the 20 rods is 1,

the sum of the counters on the 21 rods is 1,

the sum of the counters on the 22 rods is 1.

Therefore, 101two + 10two = 111two

Now, let us obtain the value of 101two + 1two using the abacuses.

22 21 20 + 22 21 20 = 22 21 20

A B CThe counter on the 20 rod in A and the counter on the 20 rod in B, cannot both be placed on the 20 rod in C, because there cannot be two counters on any rod of an abacus used to represent a binary number. Instead, one counter should be placed on the rod to the left of the 20 rod. This is shown on the rod 21 in C.

Therefore, 101two + 1two = 110two'

This is clarified further by adding the numbers vertically.

101two

110two

1two+

Adding from right to left; first, one 20s + one 20s = one 21s and zero 20s. Then, one 21s + zero 21s = one 21s. Finally, one 22s + zero 22s = one 22s.

^right hand column: 1two+ 1two = 10two&

We cannot subtract 1 from 0 in the rightmost column. Therefore, let us take 1 from the 21 column which is to the left of it.The value of this is 2 in the 20 column. Now we subtract 1 from this 2 to obtain 1 in the rightmost column. Now there is 0 instead of 1 in the column 21.

Therefore,110two− 1two= 101two'

2.5 Applications of binary numbers

The fundamental digits in the binary number system are 0 and 1. Many modern digital instruments are made based on this feature. When designing lighting system circuits, “current off” and “current on” conditions are represented by 0 and 1.

If is used to represent the current “on” condition and to represent the current “off” condition, then the combination is represented by 1001two. The storing of data and computations done in computers and calculators are based on this concept. Any number system can be developed under the same principles used to develop the binary number system. Storing of data can be done using other number systems too.

Note: If a number system is developed using base four, only the fundamental digits

0, 1, 2 and 3 are used. For example, the decimal number 4 is expressed as 10four in this number system. In the base five number system, the fundamental digits are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, and the decimal number 5 is expressed as 10five in this system.

Fractions

Let us recall the facts that were learnt about fractions in previous grades. The circle shown below is divided into five equal parts of which three are shaded.

The shaded region can be expressed as 3

5 of the whole region. We can express

this in terms of the area of the circle too. That is, the shaded area is 3

5 of the area

of the whole figure. If the total area of the circle is taken as 1 unit, then the shaded

area is 3

5 units.

When an object is divided into equal portions, one portion or several portions can be expressed as a fraction. A portion of a collection can also be expressed as a fraction.For example, if we consider a team consisting of three boys and two girls, then the

boys in the team can be considered as 3

5 of the team. Here, if the whole team is

considered as a unit, then the boys in the team can be expressed as 3

Let us now recall the facts that have been learnt previously about mixed numbers and improper fractions. Two identical circles are given below. One is shaded completely and three parts of the other (which is divided into equal parts) are shaded.

If a circle is considered as one unit, the shaded fraction is 1 + 3

8. This is usually written as 1 3

8 , which is called a mixed number (“mixed fractions” are most often called “mixed numbers”). This can also be written as 11

8 , which is called an improper fraction. It is important to remember here that the mixed number and the improper fraction are expressed by taking a circle as one unit.

This amount can be considered as one part from 5 equal parts into which 20

kilogrammes is divided.

We can write this as 20 ÷ 5.

That is, 20 × 1

5 (multiplying by the reciprocal).

20 × 1

5 = × 20

415 = 4'

According to the above facts, 1

5 of 20 can be written as 1

5 × 20.

It can be seen from the above instances that we can replace the term “of” by the operation “×”.

1

2 of 100 rupees = 1

1

5 of 20 kilogrammes = 1

Exercise 3.1

3.2 Simplifying expressions with brackets according to the BODMAS rule

A numerical expression (or algebraic expression) may involve several of the operations addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and raising to the power of. There should be agreement on the order in which these operations should be performed and a set of rules describing it. In previous grades we learnt these rules to some extent. In this section we will discuss the “BODMAS” rule that is used when simplifying fractions.

The acronym “BODMAS” stands for brackets, orders/of, division, multiplication, addition and subtraction. When simplify numerical expressions, priority is given according to the BODMAS order. However, some operations have the same priority. Multiplication and division have equal priority and so do addition and subtraction. Accordingly, expressions should be simplified as follows.

1. First, simplify all expressions within brackets.

36

For free distribution.

2. Then simplify powers and roots (expressions with indices) and the expressions

with “of ” .

* Simplifying expressions with powers and roots is not included in the syllabus.

3. Next, perform divisions and multiplications. These have equal priority and

hence if both these operations are involved, priority is given from left to right.

4. Finally perform addition and subtraction. Since these too have equal priority,

precedence is given from left to right, as in 3 above.

The BODMAS rule can be used to simplify expressions with fractions too. In some expressions of fractions the term “of” is used. For example,

512 of 6

25 As learnt in the previous section, this means 625512 × .

A consensus is needed on how a fairly complex expression such as

23 ÷ 6

25 of 5

12 × 1

2 is to be simplified. Here, precedence is given to “of” over ÷

and ×.

Note: Since “of” and “raising to the power of” have the same priority, the “O”

in BODMAS is considered to stand for both “of” and “order”. However

in this syllabus only “of” is considered.

Now, let us consider how the BODMAS rule is used in simplifying the expression

24 + 5

24 (writing both fractions with a common denominator)

= 11

Note: The order in which the mathematical operations in an expression should be

performed can be indicated very easily using brackets.

Consider the following expression.

54 × 3

4 − 1

3 of 1

5 ÷ 2

3 ÷ 8

9

How this should be simplified according to the BODMAS rule can be expressed using brackets as follows.

54 × 3

3 of 1

5 ÷ 2

3 ÷ 8

There are disadvantages in using brackets too. When brackets are used, the expression will seem long and complex. Moreover, when simplifying an expression with the aid of a calculator, we have to insert brackets carefully because there is a greater chance of making an error. Therefore, it is important to decide on a convention to simplify expressions without using brackets. Such a convention is necessary especially when writing software for computers and calculators. However, a common convention accepted worldwide has not been agreed upon yet. There are several conventions which are accepted by different countries. Similarly, manufacturers of computers and calculators also have their own conventions.

Now let us consider some examples of expressions with fractions which are simplified using the BODMAS convention.

This is only for your knowledge and will not be checked in exams.Let us consider the expression

8 − 3 × (4 + 1) + 12 ÷ 3 × 32 ÷ 4 as an example.

How the above expression is simplified using the BODMAS rule is described below.

² First the expression 4 +1 which is within brackets is simplified. This is equal

to 5. Therefore we obtain

8 − 3 × 5 + 12 ÷ 3 × 32 ÷ 4

² Next the power 32 is simplified. This is equal to 9. Hence we obtain 8 − 3 × 5 + 12 ÷ 3 × 9 ÷ 4

² Next the multiplications and divisions are performed from left to right.

Therefore, 3 × 5 is simplified first. This is equal to 15. Therefore we obtain

8 − 15 + 12 ÷ 3 × 9 ÷ 4² Next, 12 ÷ 3 is simplified. This is equal to 4. Hence we obtain 8 − 15 + 4 × 9 ÷ 4² Next, 4 × 9 is simplified. This is equal to 36. Now the expression is

8 − 15 + 36 ÷ 4

² Then 36 ÷ 4 is simplified. This is equal to 9. Therefore we obtain

8 − 15 + 9

² Now, since addition and subtraction have equal priority, simplification is done

from left to right. Therefore we obtain

− 7 + 9

² Finally we get − 7 + 9 = 2 as the answer. According to the BODMAS order,

8 − 3 × (4 + 1) + 12 ÷ 3 × 32 ÷ 4 = 2.

By studying this lesson you will be able to;

²² calculate the profit earned or loss incurred through a sale,²² calculate the profit percentage or loss percentage,²² identify what commissions and discounts are,²² perform calculations in relation to commissions and discounts.

4.1 Profit and Loss

Most of the items that we use in our day to day lives are bought from supermarkets.People who sell these items are known as sellers whereas people who buy them are known as customers.

The goods sold by sellers are either produced by them or are bought from someone else. In producing or buying goods, a cost is incurred. An item produced or purchased at a cost is generally sold at a price which is greater than the incurred cost. When selling goods at a price which is greater than the cost, it is said that the seller has earned a profit from the sale.

A seller will not always be able to sell his goods at a profit. For example, when goods are damaged or about to expire, they may have to be sold at a price which is less than the cost. In such a situation, it is said that the seller has incurred a loss.When a seller sells an item at the price at which he bought it, he neither earns a profit nor incurs a loss.

Accordingly, ifthe selling price > the cost,then a profit is earned, and

43For free distribution

profit = selling price – cost.

Similarly, if the cost > the selling price, then a loss is incurred andloss = cost – selling price.

Example 1

A company which produces shoes incurs a cost of Rs 1000 in manufacturing a pair of shoes. The company sells each pair of shoes at Rs 2600. Find the profit earned by the company in selling one pair of shoes.

The manufacturing cost of a pair of shoes = Rs 1 000

Selling price = Rs 2 600∴ Profit earned = Rs 2 600 – 1 000 = Rs 1 600 Example 2

A vendor buys a stock of fifty coconuts at the price of Rs 45 per coconut. If the vendor sells all the coconuts at the price of Rs 60 per fruit, calculate his profit.

Method IThe buying price of the stock of coconuts = Rs 45 × 50

= Rs 2 250Income generated by selling the stock = Rs 60 × 50of coconuts

= Rs 3 000

∴ The profit earned by selling the stock = Rs 3 000 – 2 250 of coconuts

= Rs 750

Method II

The purchase price of a coconut = Rs 45

The selling price of a coconut = Rs 60The profit earned by selling one coconut = Rs 60 – 45

= Rs 15The profit earned by selling the whole stock of coconuts = Rs 15 × 50

= Rs 750

Example 3

A vendor buys a stock of 100 mangoes at the price of Rs 20 each and decides to sell them at the price of Rs 18 each due to the fruits being damaged during transportation. Calculate the loss incurred by the vendor.

Method I

The purchase price of the stock of mangoes = Rs 20 × 100

= Rs 2 000

The amount made by selling the stock = Rs 18 × 100of mangoes

= Rs 1 800

The loss incurred in selling the whole stock = Rs 2 000 – 1 800of mangoes

= Rs 200

Method II

The purchase price of a mango = Rs 20

The selling price of a mango = Rs 18The loss incurred in selling a mango = Rs 20 – 18

= Rs 2The loss incurred in selling the whole stock of mangoes = Rs 2 × 100

= Rs 200

Example 4

A vendor buys 60 kg of manioc from a farmer at the price of Rs 50 per kilogramme. He initially sells 20 kg at Rs 70 per kilogramme. Of the remaining manioc he sells 15 kg at Rs 60 per kilogramme, 5 kg at Rs 50 per kilogramme and finally 10 kg at Rs 40 per kilogramme. The vendor discards the remaining 10 kg of manioc due to his inability to sell it. Determine whether the vendor earned a profit or incurred a loss from selling the manioc and calculate the profit earned or loss incurred by him.

The cost incurred in buying the manioc = Rs 50 × 60

= Rs 3 000The amount made by selling the first 20 kg of manioc = Rs 70 × 20 = Rs 1 400

45For free distribution

The amount made by selling the next 15 kg = Rs 60 × 15

of manioc = Rs 900The amount made by selling 5 kg of manioc = Rs 50 × 5 = Rs 250The amount made by selling 10 kg of manioc = Rs 40 × 10 = Rs 400The amount made by selling the whole = Rs 1400 + 900 + 250 + 400stock of manioc = Rs 2 950Since 3000 > 2950, a loss is incurred by the vendor. The loss incurred by the vendor = Rs 3000 − 2950 = Rs 50

7. A vendor bought a stock of 50 kg of onions at the price of Rs 60 per kilogramme

and sold 30 kg of it at the price of Rs 80 per kilogramme. He had to sell the remaining stock of onions at a lesser price because they were close to getting spoilt. Due to this, the vendor neither made a profit nor incurred a loss from selling the whole stock of onions. Find the price at which the vendor sold each kilogramme of the remaining stock of onions.

4.2 Profit percentage/loss percentage

Ramesh and Suresh are two vendors. Ramesh owns a clothing store. He sells a pair of trousers which he bought for Rs 800, at the price of Rs 900. Suresh owns an electrical items store. He sells an electric kettle which he bought for Rs 2500, at the price of Rs 2600.

47For free distribution

The items sold by Ramesh and Suresh are not the same, and the buying prices and selling prices of the items are also different. However, the profit earned by them from selling the items is equal.

The profit earned by Ramesh from selling a pair of trousers = Rs 900 – 800 = Rs 100 The profit earned by Suresh from selling an electric kettle = Rs 2600 – 2500 = Rs 100 Can you identify which of these two sellers engaged in the more profitable sale if both had Rs 5000 each?

Even though the profit earned by Ramesh and Suresh is equal, it is clear that the amount of money each person spent in order to earn that profit is not equal. In order to find out which was the more profitable sale, the amount of money spent by each person has to be considered. The below given calculation is performed in order to determine this.

The profit earned by Ramesh after spending Rs 800 = Rs 100

The profit earned by Ramesh as a fraction of the amount he spent = 800

100

The profit earned by Suresh after spending Rs 2500 = Rs 100

The profit earned by Suresh as a fraction of the amount he spent = 2500

100

It is easy to compare the fractions 800

100 and 2500

100since the numerators of both

fractions are equal. Since 800

100 > 2500

100 Ramesh's transaction was more profitable.

Even when the numerators are not equal, the more profitable business is determined using a similar method. Since the comparison of fractions when the denominators are different could be difficult, these fractions are most often converted into percentages to facilitate comparison. Let us calculate these percentages as follows.

48For free distribution

Since the profit earned by Ramesh written as a fraction of the cost is 800

100 ,

Ramesh’s profit percentage = 800

100× 100%

= 12.5% ' Accordingly, it is clear that the profit earned by Ramesh from spending Rs 100 is Rs 12.50.

Since the profit earned by Suresh written as a fraction of the cost is 2500

100 ,

Suresh’s profit percentage = 2500

100× 100%

= 4% ' Accordingly, it is clear that the profit earned by Suresh from spending Rs 100 is Rs 400.

Since 12.5% > 4%, it can be said that Ramesh’s transaction was more profitable.

The meaning of the percentages calculated above can be described as follows.

800100 × 100 is the profit Ramesh earns from spending Rs 100.

2500

100 × 100 is the profit Suresh earns from spending Rs 100.

The profit earned/loss incurred by a vendor when the buying price/production cost of the item is Rs 100, is known as the profit/loss percentage. Therefore, by representing the profit/loss as a fraction of the buying price/production cost and multiplying that fraction by 100%, the profit/ loss percentage can be calculated.

Profit percentage = buying price (or production cost)

profit× 100%

Loss percentage = buying price (or production cost)

Example 1

A vendor buys exercise books at Rs 25 each, and sells them at Rs 30 each. Calculate the profit percentage earned by the vendor from selling one exercise book.

Profit = Rs 30 – 25

= Rs 5

Profit percentage = 25

5 × 100%

= 20%

Example 2

A vendor buys a pair of trousers for Rs 500. Due to a damage, he sells it for Rs 450. Determine the loss percentage.

Loss = Rs 500 – 450

= Rs 50

Loss percentage = 500

50 × 100%

= 10%Example 3

A carpenter incurs a cost of Rs 4000 in making a table which he sells at Rs 5600. A blacksmith incurs a cost of Rs 250 in making a knife which he sells at Rs 360. Determine who has engaged in the more profitable sale.

The profit earned by the carpenter as a percentage = 4000

1600 × 100% = 40%of the cost incurred

The profit earned by the blacksmith as a percentage = 250

110 × 100% = 44%of the cost incurred

Therefore, the blacksmith’s transaction was more profitable.

Example 4

If a vendor buys an almirah for Rs 30 000 and earns a profit

percentage of 15% (of the purchase price) by selling it, calculate the selling price of the almirah.

Method IHere, what is meant by a profit percentage of 15% is that, if Rs 100 is invested, then a profit of Rs 15 is earned. In other words, if Rs 100 is invested, then the item is sold at the price of Rs 115.

Therefore, the selling price of the item when Rs 30 000 is = 100

115 × 30 000invested

= Rs 34 500 Method IIAs in method I above, since the profit is Rs 15 when Rs 100 is invested,

the profit earned when Rs 30 000 is invested = 100

15 × 30 000

= Rs 4 500

Therefore, the selling price of the item = cost + profit = 30 000 + 4 500 = Rs 34 500 Example 5

A vendor buys a pair of shoes for Rs 1500 and sells it at a loss of 2%. What is the selling price of the pair of shoes?

Method I

Since the pair of shoes is sold at a loss of 2%,

the selling price if the item is worth Rs 100 = Rs 98

∴ The selling price of the item worth Rs 1 500 = Rs 100

98 × 1 500

= Rs 1 470

51For free distribution

Method II

The loss incurred = Rs 1 500 × 100

2 = Rs 30∴ The selling price = Rs 1 500 – 30

= Rs 1 470 Example 6

If a vendor earns a profit of 10% by selling a television set at the price of Rs 22 000, find the price at which the vendor bought the set.

Method IIn order to earn a profit of 10% when the purchase price of the item is Rs 100, the item should be sold for Rs 110.Therefore, the purchase price of an item sold for Rs 110 at a profit = Rs 100of 10%

∴ The purchase price of an item sold for Rs 22 000 at a = Rs 110

100 × 22 000 profit of 10%

= Rs 20 000

Method II

If the purchase price of the item is Rs x, then

the profit earned = Rs x × 100

10

= Rs 10

x

The selling price of the item = Rs x + 10

x ∴ x + 10

x = 22 000

1010x + x = 22 000

1011x = 22 000

x = 22 000 × 11

10

x = 20 000

Therefore, the purchase price of the television set is Rs 20 000.

Method III

If the purchase price is Rs x,

the selling price = Rs x × 100

Therefore, the purchase price of the set is Rs 20 000.

A vendor had to sell a sports item for Rs 6 800 due to a manufacturing defect, which caused him a loss of 15%. Find the purchase price of the item.Method IThe selling price of an item which is bought at Rs 100 and sold at a loss of 15%, is Rs 85.

∴The purchase price of an item sold at Rs 85 at a loss of 15% = Rs 100

Hence, the purchase price of an item sold at Rs 6 800 at a = Rs 85

100 × 6 800loss of 15%

= Rs 8 000

Method IIIf the purchase price of the item is Rs x,

the loss incurred = Rs x × 100

15

= Rs 20

3x

∴ The selling price of the item

= Rs x −20

3x

Then, x − 20

3x = 6 800

2020x −3x = 6 800

20 17x = 6 800

x = 6 800 × 17

20

x = 8 000 ∴The purchase price of the item is Rs 8000.

4.3 Discounts and Commissions

Discounts

A discount of 20% is given on

every book

The price at which an item is expected to be sold is called the marked price. According to the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, the price of an item that is for sale needs to be marked on the item.

A notice displayed in a bookshop is given in the picture shown above. What is mentioned in the notice is that a discount of 20% is given when a book is bought. This means that, when the book is purchased, 20% will be reduced from the price mentioned on the book. The amount that is reduced is called a “discount”. Most often, a discount is indicated as a percentage of the marked price.

Since customers usually tend to buy goods from shops which offer discounts, there is an increase in sales in these shops. Due to this, the profits of the shop also increase. Discounts result in direct benefits for customers while the shop owners too gain long term benefits.

Example 1

Kaveesha buys books which are worth Rs 1500 from a bookshop which offers a discount of 20%. Calculate the discount that Kaveesha receives.

Discount = Rs 1 500 × 100

20

= Rs 300

Example 2

The production cost of a mobile phone is Rs 9000. The price of the phone has been marked keeping a profit of Rs 3000. If the phone is sold at a discount of 10% on the marked price, find the selling price.

Method IThe marked price = Rs 9000 + 3000

= Rs 12 000

Discount = Rs 12 000 × 100

10

= Rs 1 200∴ Selling price = Rs 12 000 – 1 200

= Rs 10 800 Method IISince an item of marked price Rs 100 is sold for Rs 90 when the discount is 10%,the selling price of an item of marked price Rs 100, sold at a = Rs 90discount of 10%

∴ The selling price of an item of marked price Rs 12 000, = Rs 100

90 × 12 000 sold at a discount of 10%

= Rs 10 800

Note: In the above example, two methods of solving the problem have been

given. Since the second method presented is shorter than the first, it is important to practice this method.

Example 3

Commissions

Lowest Commissions

A notice issued by a company which facilitates the sale of properties, vehicles and houses is shown in the above picture. While such companies find customers for these kinds of sales, once the deal is over, a certain percentage of the value of the transaction is charged by the company. Such companies are known as brokerages. The amount that is charged by such companies for facilitating the sale is known as the commission. This is usually a percentage of the value of the transaction.

Example 5

What is the commission charged by a company for facilitating the sale of a motorcar worth Rs 3 000 000, if a commission of 5% is charged?

The commission charged = Rs 3 000 000 × 100

5.1 Substitution

In grade 8, you learnt to find the value of an algebraic expression by substituting integers for the unknown terms. Let us now find out how to obtain the value of an algebraic expression by substituting directed numbers.

♦ 20 adults and 16 children went on a trip. Each adult was given x amount of bread

and each child was given y amount of bread for breakfast.

Let us write the total amount of bread that was distributed as an algebraic expression.

Amount of bread given to the 20 adults = 20xAmount of bread given to the 16 children = 16yTotal amount of bread that was distributed = 20x + 16y

Then x = 2

5.2 The product of two binomial expressions

Let us first recall what is meant by algebraic symbols, algebraic terms, algebraic expressions and binomial expressions. The letters x, y, z, a, b, c, …are considered as algebraic symbols.

Algebraic symbols such as x, y and z are also considered as algebraic terms.When an algebraic symbol is multiplied or divided by a number, as for example, 2x,

5y, –2a and 3

x , it too is considered as an algebraic term.

Similarly, when an algebraic symbol is multiplied or divided by another algebraic symbol, as for example, xy, ay and z

b , it is also called an algebraic term. The products and quotients of algebraic symbols and numbers such as 2xy, –3zab and

52 xy are also called algebraic terms.

64For free distribution

Algebraic terms can also be considered as algebraic expressions (expressions with one term).

A sum or a difference of algebraic terms is called an algebraic expression. For example, x + y, 2a + xyz, 4xy2 – yz and – 2x + 3xy are algebraic expressions. Similarly, when a number is added to or subtracted from an algebraic term, it is also called an algebraic expression. For example, 4 + x and 1– 3ab are algebraic expressions.

All the algebraic expressions we have considered thus far have consisted of two terms. A “binomial algebraic expression” (or simply a “binomial expression) is an expression which is a sum or difference of two terms.

However, there can be any number of terms in an algebraic expression. 3 + ax – 2xyz + xy is an algebraic expression with four terms. It has three algebraic terms and a number (constant term).

In this lesson we will be studying binomial expressions. Now let us consider the product of two binomial expressions.

Let us take the length of a side of the square shaped flower bed shown in the figure below as x units. If a larger rectangular flower bed is made by increasing the length of one side by 3 units and the length of the adjacent side by 2 units, let us consider how an algebraic expression can be constructed in terms of x, for the area of the larger flower bed.

x

x

x × x = x2

x

x3

2

x × x = x2

x × 2 = 2x3 × 2 = 6

x × 3 = 3x

The length of the larger flower bed = x + 3 unitsThe breadth of the larger flower bed = x + 2 units

According to the figure, the area of the larger flower bed = length × breadth= (x + 3) (x + 2) square (1) units

65For free distribution

Observe that (x + 3) (x + 2) is a product of two binomial expressions.

The area of the larger flower bed can also be found by using a different method, that is, by adding the areas of the four smaller sections of which it is composed. The four sections are, the initial square shaped section and the three smaller rectangular sections in the figure.

Accordingly,the area of the larger flower bed = the sum of the areas of the four smaller sections

= x2 + 2x + 3x + 6 square units= x2 + 5x + 6 square units (2) Irrespective of the method used to find the area, the expressions obtained for the area should be equal to each other. Therefore, from (1) and (2) the following equality is established.

(x + 3) (x + 2) = x2 + 5x + 6

Let us now consider how this equality can be obtained without the aid of a figure.

Let us multiply the terms within the second pair of brackets by the two terms within the first pair of brackets.

(x + 3) (x + 2) = (x + 3) (x + 2)

= x (x + 2) + 3 (x + 2)= x2 + 2x + 3x + 6= x2 + 5x + 6Accordingly, the product of two binomial expressions can be obtained in the above manner without the aid of a figure.

Let us consider another activity similar to the one above.

Factors of Algebraic Expressions6

By studying this lesson, you will be able to;• factorize algebraic expressions with four terms when the factors are binomial

expressions,• factorize trinomial quadratic expressions of the form x2 + bx + c,• factorize algebraic expressions written as a difference of two squares.

Factors of algebraic expressions

The meanings of many algebraic terms were explained in the previous lesson. In this lesson we will consider what is meant by the factors of an algebraic expression (or an algebraic term).

Consider the term 2xy. It is formed by the product of 2, x and y. Therefore, 2, x and y are all factors of 2xy.

2x + 2y is a binomial expression. It is the sum of two algebraic terms. 2 and x are factors of 2x. Similarly, 2 and y are factors of 2y. Accordingly, 2 is a factor of both the terms 2x and 2y. You have learnt in grade 8 that the above binomial expression can be written as 2 (x + y) by factoring out the common factor 2. Hence;

2x + 2y = 2 (x + y)

What is important here is that the algebraic expression 2x + 2y, which is the sum of 2x and 2y, is expressed as a product of 2 and x + y. We say that 2 and x + y are factors of 2x + 2y. That is, the algebraic expression 2x + 2y can be expressed as a product of its factors 2 and x + y.

One factor of the above algebraic expression 2x + 2y is the number 2 and another factor is the algebraic expression x + y. However, an algebraic expression could also be expressed as a product of algebraic terms or algebraic expressions. For example, since the expression xy + 5xz can be written as x(y + 5z), x and y + 5z are factors of it.

According to the facts learnt in lesson 5, when the algebraic expression x(y + 5z)which is a product is expanded, we obtain the algebraic expression xy + 5xz, which is a sum of algebraic terms. In this lesson we will study the inverse of the process that was learnt in lesson 5. That is, we will learn how to write a given algebraic expression as a product of factors.

Observe how each algebraic expression given below has been written as a product of factors as learnt in grade 8.

²² 3x + 12 = 3 (x + 4)²² 6a + 12b –18 = 6 (a + 2b – 3)²² – 2x – 6y = –2 (x + 3y) ²² 3x – 6xy = 3x (1 – 2y)

In the second example above, the common factor of the terms of the expression 6a +12b −18 is 6. Observe that this is the highest common factor of 6, 12 and 18. When a number is a common factor, we should always consider the highest common factor. Furthermore, when factorizing algebraic expressions, the numbers need not be factorized further. For example, 6x + 6y is written as 6(x + y) and not as 2 × 3 (x + y).

Do the following review exercise to establish these facts further.

Let us find the area of each rectangle in terms of the given algebraic symbols x, y, a and b.

The area of section A = a × x = ax

The area of section B = b × x = bx

The area of section C = a × y = ayThe area of section D = b × y = by

Now let us find the area of the large rectangle.

The length of the large rectangle = a + bThe breadth of the large rectangle = x + yHence, the area of the large rectangle = (a + b) ( x + y) Now, since the total area of the 4 small rectangles = the area of the large rectangle, ax + ay + bx + by = (a + b) (x + y).

We can verify the total above equality by expanding the product (a + b)(x + y) by using the method learnt in the previous lesson.

Let us expand it as follows.

(a + b)(x + y) = a (x + y) + b (x + y)

= ax + ay + bx + by

The validity of the equality is verified.

In this lesson we expect to learn how to write an expression of the form ax + bx + ay +by as a product of two factors as (a + b) (x + y). First, we need to observe that the four terms ax, ay, bx and by have no common factors. Therefore, the factoring out of a common factor cannot be done directly. However, if we consider the four terms pairwise, the expression can be factored as follows.

72For free distribution

ax + bx + ay + by = (ax + bx) + (ay + by) = x (a + b) + y (a + b)

The final expression is the sum of the two expressions x(a + b) and y(a + b).Now observe that the two expressions x (a + b) and y (a + b) have a common factor (a + b). Therefore, by factoring out this expression, we can rewrite the given expression as a product of two factors as (a + b) (x + y).

ax + bx + ay + by = x (a + b) + y (a + b) = (a + b) (x + y)

Example 1

Factorize 3x + 6y + kx + 2ky.

3x + 6y + kx + 2ky = 3 (x + 2y) + k (x + 2y) = (x + 2y) (3 + k)

Example 2

Factorize a2 – 3a + ab – 3b.

a2 – 3a + ab – 3b = a (a – 3) + b (a – 3) = (a – 3) (a + b)

Example 3

x2 + xy – x – y = x2 + xy – 1 (x + y) = x (x + y) – 1 (x + y) = (x + y) (x – 1)

6.2 Factors of trinomial quadratic expressions of the form of x2 + bx + c

Recall how we obtained the product of the two algebraic expressions (x + 3) and (x + 4).

(x + 3) (x + 4) = x (x + 4) + 3 (x + 4)

= x2 + 4x + 3x + 12

= x2 + 7x + 12Since we have obtained x2 + 7x + 12 as the product of (x + 3) and (x + 4), the expressions (x + 3) and (x + 4) are factors of x2 + 7x + 12. Expressions of the form x2 + 7x + 12 consisting of three terms of which one is a quadratic term are called trinomial quadratic expressions.

Note:The trinomial quadratic expressions we consider here can in general be written in the form x2 + bx + c. Here b and c are numerical values. For example, x2 + 7x + 12 is the trinomial quadratic expression that is obtained when b = 7 and c = 12. In general, bx is called the middle term and c is called the constant term. The expression x2 + 7x + 12 can be written as a product of two factors as (x + 3)(x + 4). However, there are some trinomial quadratic expressions which cannot be written as a product of two such factors, as for example, the expression x2 + 3x + 4.

Here, we only consider how to find the factors of those trinomial quadratic expressions that can be written as a product of two factors.

To find out how to write a trinomial quadratic expression as a product of two binomial terms, let us analyze the steps we carried out in obtaining the product of two binomial expressions, in the opposite direction. • In the trinomial quadratic expression x2 + 7x + 12, the middle term 7x has been

written as a sum of two terms as 3x + 4x.

There are many ways of writing 7x as a sum of two terms. For example,

7x = 5x + 2x and 7x = 8x + (−x ). The importance of 3x and 4x can be explained as follows.

• The product of 3x and 4x = 3x × 4x = 12x2.

• Moreover, the product of the first and last terms of the trinomial quadratic

expression x2 + 7x + 12 is also x2× 12 = 12x2.

74For free distribution

The observations from the above analysis can be used to factorize trinomial quadratic expressions. The middle term should be written as a sum of two terms. Their product should be equal to the product of the first and last terms of the expression to be factorized.

Let us factorize x2 + 6x + 8. The middle term is 6x. It should be written as a sum of two terms, and their product should be equal to x2 × 8 = 8x2.

Based on the above facts, we have to find a pair of linear terms of which the product is 8x2 and the sum is 6x. The table below shows the possible ways of writing 8x2 as a product of two linear terms.

Pair of linear termsProductSum x, 8xx × 8x = 8x2 x + 8x = 9x2x, 4x2x × 4x = 8x22x + 4x = 6x

According to the table, it is clear that the middle term 6x is obtained from 2x + 4x. Let us factorize the expression x2 + 6x + 8.

x2 + 6x + 8 = x2 + 2x + 4x + 8

= x (x + 2) + 4 (x + 2)= (x + 2) (x + 4)

∴ x + 2 and x + 4 are factors of x2+ 6x + 8.

Instead of writing the middle term as 2x + 4x, let us write it as 4x + 2x and factorize to see whether we obtain different factors.

x2 + 6x + 8 = x2 + 4x + 2x + 8

= x (x + 4) + 2 (x + 4)= (x + 4) (x + 2)

The same pair of factors are obtained. Therefore, we see that the order in which the selected pair is written does not affect the final answer.

Example 1

Factorize x2 + 5x + 6.In this expression, the product of the first and last terms = x2 × 6 = 6x2 The middle term = 5x

75For free distribution

We can factorize this expression as below, because 2x + 3x = 5x and (2x) (3x) = 6x2 x2 + 5x + 6 = x2 + 2x + 3x + 6

= x (x + 2) + 3 (x + 2)= (x + 2) (x + 3)

Example 2

Factorize x2 – 8x + 12.

The product of the first and last terms of the expression is x2 × 12 = 12x2 and the

middle term is (– 8x). Here we have a negative term. The table given below shows the various ways in which two terms in x can be selected such that their product is 12x2.

x, 12x 2x, 6x 3x, 4x −2x, −6x −3x, −4x−x, −12x

According to the table, if we write – 8x = (−2x) + (−6x), then we obtain (−2x)(−6x) = 12x2.

Hence, x2 – 8x + 12 = x2 – 2x – 6x + 12

= x (x – 2) – 6 (x – 2) = (x – 2) (x – 6)

Example 3

Factorize y2 + 2y – 15.

The product of the first and last terms of the expression = y2 × – 15 = – 15y2

The middle term = 2y

By writing –15y2 = (5y) (−3y), the middle term is obtained as (5y) + (−3y) = 2y

Therefore,

y2 + 2y – 15 = y2 – 3y + 5y – 15

= y (y – 3) + 5 (y – 3) = (y – 3) (y + 5)

76For free distribution

Example 4

Factorize a2 – a – 20.The product of the first and last terms of the expression is = a2 × (– 20) = – 20a2 and the middle term is (– a). Since –20a2 = (–5a) (4a) and (–5a) + (4a) = −a, the expression can be factored as follows.a2 – a – 20 = a2 + 4a – 5a – 20

= a (a + 4) – 5 (a + 4)= (a + 4) (a – 5)

Exercise 6.2Factorize the quadratic expressions given below.

a. x2 + 9x + 18 b. y2 + 11y + 30 c. a2 + 10a + 24d. b2 – 8b + 15 e. x2 – 5x + 6 f. m2 – 12m + 20g. a2 + a – 12 h. p2 + 5p – 24 i. p2 + 6p – 16j. x2 – x – 12 k. a2 – 3a – 40 l. r2 – 3r – 10m. y2 + 6y + 9 n. k2 – 10k + 25 o. 4 + 4x + x2

p. 36 + 15x + x2 q. 30 – 11a + a2 r. 54 – 15y + y2

Note:When factorizing trinomial quadratic expressions, writing the middle term as a sum of two suitable terms is an important step. Although a specific method has been given above to find the two terms, an easier method is to write the middle term as a sum of two terms and check whether their product is equal to the product of the first and last terms of the given expression. This skill can be mastered with practice. However, once the two terms have been written, we have to be careful when simplifying the expression. In example 4 above, when the common factor −5 is factored out from the expression −5a −20, we obtain −5(a + 4) This is often mistakenly written as −5(a − 4).

6.3 Factors of an expression written as a difference of two squares

Consider the product of the two binomial expressions (x – y) and (x + y). (x – y) (x + y) = x (x + y) – y (x + y)

= x2 + xy – xy – y2

= x2 – y2

77For free distribution

Accordingly, (x + y) (x – y) is equal to the expression x2 – y2. The expression x2 – y2

is said to be a difference of two squares.

The fact that (x + y) (x – y) = x2 – y2 means that x + y and x – y are factors of x2 – y2 .

Let us see whether we can find the factors of x2 – y2 by considering it as a quadratic expression in x. We can rewrite it as a trinomial quadratic expression in x by writing the middle term as 0. We then obtain the expression x2 + 0 – y2. Now consider its factorization.

The product of the first and last terms of the expression is = x2 × (– y2) = – x2 y2 and the middle term is 0.Now,

–x2 y2 = (– x y) × (x y) and – x y + xy = 0

Therefore, x2 + 0 – y2 = x2 – xy + xy – y2

= x (x – y) + y (x – y) = (x – y) (x + y)

Again we obtain x2 – y2 = (x – y) (x + y).

Now let us consider how to find the factors of the difference of two squares by considering areas.

Consider a square of side length a units.

From this square, cut out a square of side length b units.

By studying this lesson, you will be able to;² identify five fundamental axioms of mathematics,² develop geometrical relationships and solve problems involving calculations

using the five fundamental axioms.

Axioms

Statements which are considered to be self-evident and are accepted without proof are called axioms. In mathematics, axioms are used to explain facts logically, develop relationships and reach conclusions.

Euclid, who is considered to be the father of geometry lived in Greece around 300 B.C. He introduced certain axioms related to mathematics in his book “Elements”. Some of them are unique to geometry. Others are common axioms which can be used in other areas including algebra.

We consider five common axioms in this lesson. They can be summarized as given below.

1. Quantities which are equal to the same quantity, are equal.2. Quantities which are obtained by adding equal quantities to equal quantities, are equal.3. Quantities which are obtained by subtracting equal quantities from equal quantities, are equal.4. Products which are equal quantities multiplied by equal quantities, are equal.5. Quotients which are equal quantities divided by nonzero equal quantities, are equal.

By “quantities” we usually mean lengths, areas, volumes, masses, speeds, magnitudes of angles, etc.

These five axioms are very important because we can derive many results related to algebra and geometry by using them. Let us study these axioms in detail.

Axioms7

Axiom 1

Quantities which are equal to the same quantity, are equal.

We can write this axiom briefly as given below. If b = a and c = a, then b = c.

According to this axiom,

‘If Hasith’s age is the same as Kasun’s and Harsha’s age is also the same as Kasun’s, then Hasith’s age is the same as Harsha’s.’

How Axiom 1 is used to obtain geometrical results is seen in the simple example given below.

In the quadrilateral ABCD shown below BC = AB and CD = AB .

A

BC

D

According to the above axiom, BC = CD.

Example 1

In the triangle ABC, AB = AC and AB = BC If AC = 5 cm then determine the perimeter of the triangle ABC.

A

BC

Since AC = 5 cm and AC = AB, according to Axiom 1, AB = 5 cm.Since AB = 5 cm and AB = BC, according to Axiom 1, BC = 5 cm. The perimeter of the triangle ABC = AC + BC + AB = 5 cm + 5 cm + 5 cm = 15 cm

Axiom 2

Quantities which are obtained by adding equal quantities to equal quantities, are equal.

We can write this briefly as given below.

If a = b, then a + c = b + c.

This axiom can be written as given below too.

If x = y and p = q, then x + p = y + q.

According to this axiom,

“If the cost incurred in purchasing vegetables is equal to the cost incurred in purchasing milk and the cost incurred in purchasing fruits is equal to the cost incurred in purchasing eggs, then the cost incurred in purchasing vegetables and fruits is equal to the cost incurred in purchasing milk and eggs.”

Let us consider a simple geometrical result that can be derived using the above axiom.

Axiom 4

Products which are equal quantities multiplied by equals, are equal.

We can write this briefly as given below. If a = b, then ca = cb.

88For free distribution

Let us first consider an application of this axiom in geometry.

² As indicated in the figure given below, the points A, B, C and D are

located on the straight line XY, such that XA = AB = BC = CD = DY. The points K, L, M and N are located on the straight line PQ, such that PK = KL = LM = MN = NQ. It is also given that XA = PK.

Let us show that XY = PQ.

Since XA = AB = BC = CD = DY, it is clear that 5 XA = XY.Similarly, since PK = KL = LM = MN = NQ, we obtain that 5 PK = PQ.Since XA = PK, by applying Axiom 4 we obtain 5 XA = 5 PK.... XY = PQ.

Although it is important to understand how results are derived by using axioms, in practice, when deriving geometrical results, the relevant axioms are not mentioned. This is because, as implied by the word “axiom”, the validity of the derivation is obvious.

Now, let us consider how this axiom is applied in algebra.

If x = 5 and y = 2x, let us find the value of y.Since x = 5, applying the above axiom and multiplying both sides by 2 we obtain 2x = 2 × 5.But 2 × 5 = 10. Hence by Axiom 1 we obtain

y = 10.

Example 1

The points X and Y are located on the side AB of the triangle ABC such that AX = XY = YB. The points P and Q are located on the side AC such that AP = PQ = QC. If AX = AP, find the relationship between AB and AC.

We can write this briefly as given below.

If a = b then a

Here, c is a nonzero number since it is meaningless to divide by zero.

Further applications of the axioms

Example 1

Solve the equation given below using the axioms.2x + 5 = 13

Here, solving the equation means finding the value of x. Since the quantity 2x + 5 is equal to the quantity 13, according to Axiom 3, the quantities obtained by subtracting 5 from these two quantities are also equal. ∴ 2x + 5 − 5 = 13 − 5.Simplifying this we obtain,2x = 8.Since the quantity 2x is equal to the quantity 8, the quantities that are obtained by dividing these two quantities by 2 are also equal. Therefore, 2x

2 = 8

2 .

When we simplify this we obtain x = 4. That is, the solution of the equation is 4.

8.1 Angles related to straight lines

Let us assume that the point O is located on the straight line AB.

ABO

Then AOB

can be considered as an angle between the arms AO and OB. Such an angle is known as a straight angle.

98For free distribution

The unit “degree” which is used to measure angles has been selected such that a straight angle is equal in magnitude to 180°. Therefore, we can write AOB

>

= 180

o.

ABO

AOB

>

= 180

o

Accordingly, the magnitude of a straight angle is180o.

In the following figure, two angles have been drawn at the point O which is located on the straight line AB.

ABO

C

Here, AOC

>

and BOC

are a pair of adjacent angles. In a situation such as this, we say that the adjacent angles AOC

and BOC

>

are on the straight line AB. Furthermore, since AOB

>

= 180

o, it is clear that,

AOC

>

+ BOC

>

= 180

o.

Hence, the two angles AOC

>

and BOC

>

are a pair of supplementary adjacent angles. The facts we have discussed can be stated as a theorem as follows.

Theorem:The sum of the adjacent angles formed by a straight line meeting another straight line is two right angles.

The facts discussed above can be generalized further. As an example, in the figure given below, four angles have been drawn at the point O on the straight line AB.

The values of these angles in degrees have been denoted by a, b, c and d. In a situation such as this too, we say that the angles are on the straight line AB. Furthermore, since AOB

= 180

o, it is clear that,

a + b + c + d = 180.It is also clear that this relationship holds true for any number of angles on a straight line. Therefore,

“The sum of the magnitudes of the angles on a straight line is 180°.”

Now, by considering some examples, let us learn how to solve problems using these theorems.

In the figure, the straight lines AB and CD intersect each other at O.

The vertex O is common to both the angles AOC

and DOB

. Furthermore, they are on opposite sides of O.

The pair of angles AOC

and DOB

are known as a pair of vertically opposite angles.

Similarly, AOD

lie on opposite sides of O, which is the common vertex of these two angles.

102For free distribution

Therefore AOD

and BOC

are also a pair of vertically opposite angles.

Accordingly, it is clear that two pairs of vertically opposite angles are formed by the intersection of two straight lines. Let us now consider a theorem related to vertically opposite angles.

Theorem:The vertically opposite angles formed by the intersection of two straight lines are equal.

By considering the figure, it can clearly be seen that ‘vertically opposite angles are equal’. However, by using the fact we learnt earlier, that ‘the sum of the angles on a straight line is 180’, and also the axioms learnt in the previous lesson, this theorem can be proved as follows.

Activity 2

You would have observed in the above activity that when two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal,

(i) each pair of corresponding angles is equal, (ii) each pair of alternate angles is equal, (iii) each pair of allied angles is supplementary.This result is true in general and can be expressed as a theorem as follows.

Liquid Measurements9

By studying this lesson, you will be able to;² determine the relationship between milllilitres (ml) and cubic centimetres (cm3), litres (l) and cubic centimetres (cm3), litres(l) and cubic metres (m3), as units which are used to measure liquid volumes, and² solve problems involving units which are used to measure liquid volumes.

Volume and capacity

We know that the amount of space occupied by a solid or a liquid is known as its volume. A solid has a definite shape and a definite volume. Although a liquid has a definite volume, it does not have a definite shape. A liquid always takes the shape of its container.The below given pictures show 200 ml of drink in different shaped containers

200 ml200 ml200 ml200 ml

When that quantity of drink is poured into the different shaped containers, even though the liquid takes the shape of the container, its volume of 200 ml remains unchanged. In the first picture, the container is completely filled with the 200 ml of drink. Therefore, the capacity of that container is 200 ml. The capacity of a container is the maximum volume that it can hold.

Do the following review exercise to recall the facts that you have learnt earlier in relation to volume and capacity.

9'1 The relationship between a cubic centimetre and a millilitre

A syringe used by doctors is given in the above figure. The amount of liquid medicine injected into a patient can be identified using the scale indicated on the syringe.

The units of measurement are indicated as cc/ ml. cc means “cubic centimetre”. It consists of the initial letters of these two words. A cubic centimetre is the volume of a cube of side length 1 cm.

The back slash (/) means “or”. It indicates that the amount of medicine can be expressed in terms of either cc or ml. The question which arises immediately is whether 1 cc is equal to 1 ml. In the metric system, 1 ml is defined such that it is equal to1 cc. Accordingly,

1 cubic centimetre = 1 millilitre

1 cm3 = 1 ml

Based on the activity the following equalities are obtained.

10 cm3 = 10 ml 20 cm3 = 20 mlAccordingly, it is clear that 1 cm3 = 1 ml.

This relationship can be used when solving problems related to liquid volumes in containers.

Example 1 A cuboid shaped glass container of length 20 cm, width 15 cm and height 10 cm is filled with a liquid medicine.

i. Find the volume of the container in cubic centimetres. ii. What is the capacity of the container in litres? iii. If the liquid in the container is to be stored in phials of capacity 50 ml each,

find the number of phials required to store all the liquid in the container.

i. The volume of the container = 20 cm 15 cm 10 cm = 3000 cm3

ii. The capacity of the container = 3000 ml = 3 l

iii. The total amount of liquid = 3000 ml

The number of phials of capacity 50 ml each that are required = 3000 .

800 l of water is in a cuboid shaped concrete tank consisting of a base of length 2 m and width 1 m. Find the height to which the water is filled in the tank.Let us construct an equation, assuming that the tank is filled up to a height of x cm, and by solving it find the height to which it is filled.Let us first convert all the measurements into centimetres.

The length of the tank = 2 m = 200 cm The width of the tank = 1 m = 100 cm

122For free distribution

The volume of water in the tank if the water level is x cm = 200 cm 100 cm x cm = 20 000x cm3

It is given that the volume of water in the tank is 800 l. ∴Volume of water in the tank = 800 l = 800 000 ml = 800 000 cm3

Since the volume of water represented above in two ways is equal,

20 000 x = 800 000

x = 800 000

20 000

= 40 ... The height of the water in the tank is 40 cm.

9.2 The relationship between a litre and a cubic metre

The need for a unit which is larger than ml or l arises when it is necessary to measure large volumes of liquid such as the quantity of liquid in an oil tank or a swimming pool. In such instances a large unit called cubic metre is used.

In order to identify a cubic metre, let us calculate the capacity of a cube shaped container of side length 1 m.

1 m

1 m

1 m

The capacity of the container shown in the figure = 1 m 1 m 1 m = 1 m3

However, since 1 m = 100 cm,the capacity of the container, 1 m3 = 100 cm 100 cm 100 cm = 1 000 000 cm3

= 1 000 000 ml (Since 1 cm3 = 1 ml)

= 1000 000

1000 l (Since 1000 ml = 1 l)

= 1 000 l

124For free distribution

Accordingly,

one cubic metre is equal to 1000 l.

1 m3 = 1000 l

Example 3 The internal length, width and height of a cuboid shaped tank in which water is stored for the daily use of a household are 1.5 m, 1 m and 1 m respectively.

(i) What is the capacity of the tank in litres? (ii) If the residents use 300 l per day, for how many days will a completely filled

tank be sufficient?

(i) The capacity of the tank = 1.5 m 1 m 1 m = 1.5 m3

= 1 500 l (Since 1 m3 = 1000 l)

(ii) The volume of water used per day = 300 l

The volume of water in the tank = 1 500 l ... The number of days for which the water is sufficient = 1 500

300

= five days
