Therefore, King Rajasinghe II sought the support of the Dutch to drive the Portuguese from the country. However, after driving the Portuguese, the Dutch broke the agreement that had been entered into with the King and went on to establish their power in many of the areas that had previously been captured by the Portuguese. Consequently, by year 1658, there had established a Dutch rule in the coastal areas of Sri Lanka. Thereafter, the Dutch ruled those areas until 1796. This chapter discusses the establishment of Dutch rule in the coastal areas of Sri Lanka, nature of the relationships that the Dutch maintained with the Kandyan kingdom and the salient features of the political, economic and cultural affairs during the Dutch rule in Sri Lanka.",

Holland, the motherland of the Dutch, was at that time a colony of Spain. The Spanish were Roman Catholics and the Dutch were Protestants; hence, there existed religious controversies between these two nations. The Dutch, therefore, began to rebel against the Spanish for winning independence. Meanwhile, Prince Phillip II, who became the King of Spain, also inherited the kingship of Portugal and got the opportunity to work against the Dutch. Consequently, King Phillip II prohibited the Dutch to arrive at Lisbon Harbour. Since the Dutch ships could not enter the Lisbon Harbour, in order for the Dutch to get the spices and other commodities they needed for their trade, they had no alternative other than reaching Asia where spices and such commodities were produced.",

During that period they did not allow a single Dutch, English or French national, except for those whom they completely trusted, to come to Asia on their ships. The Dutch, however, succeeded in discovering the sea route to Asia by about year 1595 by employing spies in various ways and by other means. Thus several Dutch Trade Companies had arrived in Asia by year 1602; however, a competition was created among Dutch companies themselves in buying the commodities produced in Asia. Further, none of those Dutch companies had been given any legal authority to act in Asia on behalf of Holland. Having taken this situation into consideration, the Dutch ruler went on to amalgamate several Dutch trade companies and formed the Dutch East India Trade Company or the VOC Company in 1602. According to the royal mandate of this company, it was granted powers to engage in trade activities in Asia on behalf of the Dutch government, to conquer areas, to build fortresses, to appoint governors and to rule the relevant areas.",

Therefore he took action to get the support of the Dutch who had a strong naval power. Accordingly, he had discussions with the representatives from the Eastern Headquarters of the Dutch in Batavia. The king agreed to give to the Dutch the proprietorship of the Cinnamon trade in Sri Lanka and also a harbour in the eastern coast of Sri Lanka in return for the support they would give him to drive the Portuguese. The objective of the king in doing so was not at all to bring another European nation in place of the one already present in the country. Consequent to the discussions that took place between the king and the Dutch, the king\u2019s army, together with the Dutch, surrounded the Portuguese fortress in Batticaloa. After launching several attacks on the Portuguese, the troops succeeded in driving the Portuguese from the fortress. Delighted with this victory, King Rajasinghe II entered into an agreement with the Dutch in the month of May in 1638.",

This visit caused fear in the Dutch who then invaded the Kandyan Kingdom sending six brigades along six different routes under the guidance of Governor Baron Van Eck. However, the Kandyans did not allow a single brigade to reach at least close to the City of Kandy. The Kandyans launched attacks on the Dutch using their familiar fighting strategies and the Dutch, having lost all their hopes with the defeat they suffered, retreated to the low country. Before long after this defeat, the Dutch once again invaded the Kandyan Kingdom in 1765. In this invasion both parties suffered heavy losses. When the Dutch entered the City of Kandy in February 1765, the king ran away to Hanguranketha for safety. The king did not agree to the conditions proposed by the Dutch who captured the City of Kandy. However, the Dutch became fed up with the diseases that spread after the beginning of the rainy reason and also with the attacks launched by the Kandyans, and finally returned to the low country.",

As travelling between Sri Lanka, Batavia and Holland took a long time at that time, and because of the difficulties there existed in maintaining communication, the Governor in this country had the opportunity of making indepenent decisions, particularly regarding urgent matters.",

They knew that the quality of the cinnamon that was produced in Sri Lanka was very much higher than that produced in the other Asian countries under Dutch rule. Therefore, the Dutch were particularly interested in promoting the cinnamon cultivation and processing and trading cinnamon. At the initial period, the Dutch got the cinnamon that naturally grew in the woods peeled by the local people in the area, but later they cultivated cinnamon in areas such as Colombo, Kalutara, Aluthgama and Matara. Mahabadde Department, which existed from the time of the Portuguese to handle affairs relating to collection and trading of cinnamon, was brought under a separate captain by the Dutch and it was made function more efficiently. The traditional labour roster method was used to peel cinnamon. The Dutch made a register of the names of cinnamon peelers and took steps to get the maximum service of those peelers. Annually, an adult peeler had to peel a particular amount of cinnamon to the Company free of charge. In this way, the Dutch earned huge profits by trading cinnamon.",

As a result of the French Revolution, France invaded Holland and seized power in Holland; consequently, Prince William V fled to Britain. Hence, there established a French rule in Holland and the English feared that the coastal areas in Sri Lanka which were under the Dutch rule would also be captured by the French. Taking advantage of this situation, the English got Prince William to sign a letter granting to the English the coastal areas of Sri Lanka that were under the Dutch rule. As this letter was written at the Kew Palace in England, it came to be called the Kew letter. When the Kew letter was handed over to the then Dutch Governor Van Angelbeek, he did not agree to act accordingly. In response to the Governor\u2019s refusal, the English decided to take to military action. Accordingly, the English launched an attack on the Fredrick Fort in Trincomalee which was under Dutch rule and captured it on 26 th August 1795. Later the English succeeded in capturing all the forts in Jaffna, Mannar, Kalpitiya and Colombo respectively. By February 1796, all the coastal areas of this country which had been under Dutch rule had been brought under the rule of the English East India Company.",

In 1800, Governor North sent an army led by General McDowall to Kandy and made efforts at getting King Sri Vickrama Rajasinghe agree to conditions that were advantageous for the English, but those efforts did not yield the expected results as the King did not agree to the conditions laid down by the English.

A strong protest came from the people against the poll-tax, dog tax and the gun tax. In July 1848, a group of protesters led by Madugalle, Rate Mahattaya of Dumbara, came to meet the Agent of Kandy in protest against the new taxes. Police officer Lokubanda Dunuwila, who came to disperse these protesters, was assaulted by the protesters until he fell off from horseback. It did not take long for these protests to develop into a rebellion against British rule. The leading centre of this struggle was Matale. By July 1848, the areas namely Matale, Kurunegala, Nuwarakalaviya, Thamankaduwa, and Harispatthuwa had fallen into the hands of the combatants. However, the efforts of the combatants to capture Kandy were not successful.",

Although coconut had been grown in this country since ancient times, it had not been cultivated as an export crop. Literary sources of this country reveal that the rulers of this country from the times of Dambadeniya kingdom to Kotte kingdom had taken steps to expand coconut cultivation in the country. However, developing coconut cultivation as an export crop was started during the British rule. By about year 1910, coconut cultivation had expanded in about 850,000 acres centred around Kurunegala, Gampaha and Chilaw areas. The owners of most of the coconut estates of this country were local businessmen, and export of coconut was handled almost completely by foreign companies. The coconut produced in this country was exported in the forms of coconut oil, copra and poonac. A coconut research institute was established in Lunuwila for the development of coconut cultivation and for research activities as well.",

This can be considered as the beginning of rubber cultivation in Sri Lanka. After year 1910, local planters drew more attention towards cultivating rubber. Rubber cultivation expanded rapidly during the period from year 1900 to 1906 and the price of rubber, too, increased comparatively during that period. Some planters gave up cinnamon cultivation and planted rubber in those lands. The following are some of the factors that led to the development of rubber cultivation:",

From the beginning of the 20th century, there also arose the need for creating employment opportunities for the increasing population. Developing local agriculture was also a solution to the problem of unemployment. According to the Donoughmore reforms of 1931, Sri Lankan Ministers were appointed to a number of ministries including the Ministry of Agriculture. Furthermore, as universal franchise was introduced under the Donoughmore constitution, politicians had to pay more attention to the needs of the rural people of the country. As a result, further steps were taken to develop the agriculture. Launching a movement to establish farmer colonies in the Dry Zone by D.S. Senanayake during the period when State Council was in effect is an example for this.",

Moreover, another movement was launched to restore the stupas and statues that had fallen into ruin throughout the country and to develop them. Further, Walisinghe Harischandra initiated a movement to protect the Buddhist sacred places in Anuradhapura that had fallen to ruin. Anagarika Dharmapala went to India and took steps to protect the Buddhist sacred places in India. Meanwhile, eminent playwrights such as John De Silva wrote plays based on themes related to History and Buddhism, and staged them. Writers such as Piyadasa Sirisena wrote fictions and they also wrote to newspapers highlighting the value of the local culture.",

Arumuga Navalar often emphasized the need for establishing Hindu schools and establishing a press in order to publish reading material for Hindu children to educate them on Hindu religion and also to teach them practices and rituals of the Hindu religion. Accordingly, with the support of donors, Arumuga Navalar established in Jaffna a Hindu school named Saiva Prakasha Vidyasalai. Because of the experience he had gained at missionary schools, he was able to prepare the curriculum for these schools to suit the need of the time. Later on, a number of Hindu schools were established throughout the Jaffna District, but those established by Navalar were the leading ones among them. Saiva administrative council and Hindu education council were established, and steps were taken to establish Hindu schools through those councils. In order to teach English to Tamil children, Shivangala Vidyalaya was established in Jaffna in 1872. Later it became famous as Hindu College in Jaffna. Arumuga Navalar who rendered a valuable service to the Tamil community as described above, passed away in 1879.",

Towards the end of the 19th century, a national independence movement was launched against the rule of the British in India and, by the beginning of the following century, it had developed into a very strong patriotic movement. An outstanding feature of the independence movement of India was that all Indians, who spoke different languages and who belonged to various ethnic groups, got united and rose with extreme patriotism against the British to win independence for their motherland. Because of such features, the independence movement in India was an example to the other British colonies in Asia. The impact of the Europeans on India, spread of power in India by the English, the nature of the independence movement of India and the outstanding leaders who led that movement are discussed in this lesson.",

After the Portuguese, the Dutch, the English and the French arrived in India and then there arose disputes among those groups themselves on trade activities and spread of political power in India. Even by that time, several European nations had established warehouses and fortresses along the coastal areas of India and therefore the conflicts that erupted between those groups had an impact on India, too. At the early period after the arrival of the European nations in India, their main intentions were to earn profits through trade and to spread religion; however, with the eruption of conflicts between themselves, they took an intense interest in spreading political power in India. In the process of spreading political power in India, the English were doing well ahead of the other nations. As a result, India became a colony of the British Empire.",

The Dutch first directed their attention towards the southeastern countries where spices grew in abundance. After driving the Portuguese from the islands where spices grew, the Dutch then turned towards India. In the same way as Albuquerque implemented measures to spread Portuguese power, the Dutch national Pieterszoon Coen took steps to spread the Dutch power in Asia. Consequently, Dutch power was established in areas such as Gujarat, Bengal, Orissa, and Bihar in India.",

The cartridges used for such rifles came in a packing which had to be broken open with the teeth in order to take the cartridges out. A rumour spread among Sepoy soldiers that beef tallow or lard (pork fat tallow) had been applied on those cartridges. Hindus considered the cow to be a sacred animal while the Muslims considered the pig to be an unclean animal. Sepoy soldiers believed it to be degrading treatment by the English to make them break open such fat smeared packaging with the mouth. Therefore Sepoy soldiers refused to use this new type of rifle. As English officers imposed penalties on Sepoy soldiers who refused to use those rifles, the conflict between the English and Sepoy soldiers escalated. That was the immediate cause of the Sepoy rebellion. Meanwhile, a Sepoy soldier named Mangal Pandey shot an English military officer. As the English imposed penalty on Mangal Pandey, the disappointment of the Sepoy soldiers seemed to have further intensified. Consequently, on 10th May 1857, the Sepoy soldiers in the Meerut military camp shot the English military officers, kept them in confinement, freed the other Indian soldiers and launched the rebellion.",

Except for the firearms the rebels had plundered from the armouries belonging to the English, the rebels did not have any means of providing the required weaponry either. For these reasons, the rebels had to fight against the English under very difficult circumstances. The facts that nearly one half of the Indian soldiers continued to support the English army and that some of the citizens did not join the rebellion also contributed to the suppression of the rebellion by the English. The Indians who joined the rebellion did not lack fighting spirit, commitment to fight and dissension against the English, but the attacks the English launched could be resisted only because of the courage the Indians had.

Further, organizations such as Prarthana Samaj and Arya Samaj were prominent among the organizations that worked towards bringing about the Hindu religious and cultural revival. In addition to them, organizations such as Ahmadiyya movement and Aligarh movement contributed towards bringing about a cultural revival among the Muslims while organizations such as Singh Sabha brought about a cultural revival among the Sikhs. These organizations functioned in a humanitarian manner and, towards the end of the 19th century, they were actively engaged in working towards shaping the thinking of the Indians to suit the time. During the rule of the British, the highway system and communication in India were developed and as a result the entire country was administratively combined. This situation contributed immensely towards creating an Indian nationalism dominating the identities of different communities such as Hindus, Muslims, Bengalese, and Punjabis, that had existed up to that time. During the period of the religious revival, steps were taken to raise awareness among people by way of assembling people belonging to various ethnic communities and addressing them and also through printed media including newspapers. This also resulted in a revival in the field of education in line with the religious revival. At this time there was a great interest in establishing new schools in India, giving education to women and improving the education of women.",

Accordingly, Allan Octavian Hume, who was a retired officer of the civil service of India, implemented necessary measures to form such an organization in which the entire country was represented. Hume, who was the founder of the Indian National Association, was given the necessary support by the English government as well. The English thought that, if all the scholars in India were brought together into one association, the government could easily learn the opinion of those scholars. Accordingly, under the guidance of Hume, a number of representatives who represented various organizations that existed in India gathered in Bombay in December 1885 and formed the Indian National Association. It was a landmark event in the history of the independece movement of India. W.C. Banerji, who was a Bengali national, was appointed as the first President of the Indian National Association. Thereafter, it became the key organization which led the political protests in India.",

However, when the government did not accommodate their demands, it became clear to the members of the Association that such limited activities were not effective in getting their demands fulfilled by the government. During the period from 1905 to 1919, there was a change in the policies of the Indian National Association and also in their activities as well. Such changes seemed to have been caused by the facts that the powers of the moderates within the association had weakened by that time and a group of youth who were radicals had become more powerful within the Association. These youths rejected the policies of those moderates and, hence, they were called extremists. These extremists believed that, rather than being cooperative with the government, more aggressive measures would have to be taken against the government in order to get their demands fulfilled.",

Accordingly, on 15 August 1947, India became an independent country that is completely free from the rule of the British. By the time India was granted independence, it had to be divided into two countries as India and Pakistan as a result of the conflicts that had escalated between the Hindus and the Muslims. As Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad, who was a prominent leader of India\u2019s independence movement, had stated, the ethnic conflicts that existed between the Hindus and the Muslims did not end. As far as the independence movement of India is concerned, it is also evident that, although the British who had established a vast empire succeeded in defeating the great dictator of German, Hitler, in the World War II with the support of its allies, they failed to defeat the non-violent movement of Gandhi of India.",

Therefore, under such circumstances, the mother government of Britain had to spend out of its own funds to cover up the expenses of the government of this country. Up to that time it had not been the policy of the Government of Britain to spend out of the funds of the mother government on the expenses of its colonies. Therefore, the Colonial Secretary appointed a special commission to come to Sri Lanka and to examine the revenue situation and the expenditure of the government, to study the existing shortcomings of the administration system and to make necessary recommendations. The commission that was appointed was headed by W.M.G. Colebrooke and therefore was called the Colebrooke Commission. Colebrooke was assigned the responsibility to examine the nature of economic and administration affairs. Later, Charles Hay Cameron was appointed to look into the judicial affairs of this country and to make necessary recommendations.",

Hence the government had to spend a lot of money on paying salaries to them and on providing accommodation and other facilities to them. Therefore Colebrooke proposed that, in order to cut down expenses, local official should be employed instead of bringing officers from Europe. In order to be able to do so, there arose the need for expanding English language education. Colebrooke believed that officers needed for administration affairs of the government could be provided by way of giving a good education in the English medium to local people who could afford to pay for their education.",

These Europeans were the rich people who had come to Lanka for cultivating crops and had engaged in plantation activities in upcountry areas. By that time there had arisen the need for them to get the required funds allocated by the Legislative for developing the road system, postal and communication services and other facilities in the areas where their cultivations were located. As stated above, three unofficial members had been appointed to the Legislative Council to represent these Europeans. However, they launched such protests because the number of official members in the Legislative Council was greater than that of the unofficial members and because the Legislative Council had not been given sufficient powers. In order to carry out those protests, they formed an organization called Planters\u2019 Association of Ceylon in 1865. Europeans such as William Digby and George Wall were the prominent leaders of those protests.",

The Congress was also making arrangements to boycott the election that was to be held under the 1920 reforms. During this period, severe public agitations were growing in India against the rule of the English. The English feared that a similar situation would occur in Sri Lanka, too. Therefore, Governor Manning gave the promise to the Ceylon National Congress that another reform would be introduced very soon if the National Congress agreed to the 1920 reforms and acted accordingly. It was as a result of this promise that constitutional reforms were introduced once again in 1924. These reforms were drawn up by the Colonial Secretary Devonshire on the recommendation of the Governor William Manning and therefore were called Manning \u2013 Devonshire reforms.",

Therefore, ordinary people did not have the right to vote at elections; thus the number of those who were eligible to vote was as small as 4% of the total population. The Donoughmore commission pointed out that, when ordinary people were kept out of the political platform in this manner, the attention of the politicians would not be directed towards the needs of the ordinary people. Therefore, the commission recommended that universal franchise should be granted in order to politically empower ordinary people and to make politicians draw their attention towards the wellbeing of ordinary people. Accordingly, both males and females over 21 years were given the right to vote at elections. This can be considered as a great victory achieved by the ordinary people. In this way, out of all colonies of the British Empire, Sri Lanka became the first Asian country to gain universal franchise without any difference.",

In terms of the Soulbury constitution, two members of the senate had to be appointed to the cabinet of ministers and one of these two should be the Minister of Justice. Maintaining the independence of the judiciary was the objective of setting out such provisions. Collective responsibility to Parliament was a significant feature of the Cabinet of Ministers.",

After the UNP, it was the Lanka Sama Samaja Party that won the highest number of seats; it won 10 seats. The total number of seats that all the other parties won was 22. It is significant to note that 21 independent candidates who contested at this election won their seats. D.S.

Senanyake\u2019s representatives explained to the Government of Britain that, as a country that supported Britain in its difficult times during the World War II, Sri Lanka, too, has the right to get independence. The English, who admitted that the arguments put forward by the Lankans were reasonable, stated even before the election of 1947 that action would be taken by the Government of Britain to give independence to Sri Lanka after the election was over. Even the British were pleased that the UNP won in the election of 1947 and that D.S. Senanayake became the Prime Minister of the country. As the newly elected Prime Minister, D.S. Senanayake entered into an agreement with Britain on security matters. In terms of this agreement, Britain agreed to take necessary action to ensure the security of Lanka and Sri Lanka agreed to allow Britain to use the harbours, airports and other places in Sri Lanka for military activities if Britain required. After the said agreement had been signed, in November 1947, the Parliament of Britain passed the Ceylon Independence Act which contained provisions for giving independence to Sri Lanka. As per the order issued by the King, this act came into effect from 4th February 1948. With the enactment of this Act, Sri Lanka once again became an independent country.",

Through that report they had recommended that the government should go into small and medium scale industries rather than establishing large-scale ones. The report of another commission, which had been appointed by the government to examine and report the situation of the commercial enterprises of the government, was published in 1953. This report also included recommendation regarding some of the principles that should be followed by the government in developing the industrial sector. These reports were very helpful in developing the government policy on industry. Accordingly, the government policy on industries was declared in year 1954. It included the policy of making government intervention in setting up small industries rather than large-scale ones and encouraging the private sector to establish other industries. The government policy that was prepared based on these facts for attracting foreign investments into the country was explained through a White Paper that was presented to parliament in 1955. Accordingly, doors were opened for the private sector, too, to invest in setting up industries in this country. Some of the significant events that took place in the industrial sector of this country after 1956 were as follows: \u00b2 establishment of the first industrial estate in Ekala in 1959, and the establishment of Ratmalana industrial estate in 1960,",
