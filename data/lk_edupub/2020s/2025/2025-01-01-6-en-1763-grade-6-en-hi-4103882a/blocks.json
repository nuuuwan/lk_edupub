He started cultivating grains such as wheat, barley, paddy, and kurakkan (finger millet) during this era. Some animals were tamed and milk, eggs, meat and fur were taken from them. Therefore, in addition to agriculture, animal husbandry too became widespread among Neolithic people. For the first time, they discovered iron during this time. As a result of this discovery, they were able to make tools out of iron instead of stones. Their habit of living in one place, which started in the Mesolithic era, developed to the extent of forming villages. Worshipping gods for protection of animals and agricultural activities started in this era.

These in turn influenced the origin of civilizations to a great extent. As a result of engaging in agriculture for a considerable period of time, there was an abundance of food. This led to an increase in wealth and property among some people. Thus, during the Neolithic era, the division between rich and poor occurred for the first time.
