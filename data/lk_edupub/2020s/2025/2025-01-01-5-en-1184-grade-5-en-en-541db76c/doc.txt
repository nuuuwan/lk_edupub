Nava jeevana demine, nithina apa pubudukaran matha

Gnana veerya vadawamina regena yanu mana jaya bhoomi kara

Eka mavakage daru kela bevina

Yamu yamu vee nopama

Prema vada sema bheda durerada

Namo, Namo Matha

The manner of career opportunities are liable to change specifically in the near future.

Hence , you have to dedicate yourselves to become productive citizens. I believe that the knowledge this book provides will suffice your aim.
