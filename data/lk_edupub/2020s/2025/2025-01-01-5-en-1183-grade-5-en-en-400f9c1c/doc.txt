Being innovative, changing with right knowledge Be a light to the country as well as to the world

Message from the Hon. Minister of Education

The past two decades have been significant in the world history due to changes that took place in technology. The present students face a lot of new challenges along with the rapid development of Information Technology, communication and other related fields. The manner of career opportunities are liable to change specifically in the near future. In such an environment, with a new technological and intellectual society, thousands of innovative career opportunities would be created. To win those challenges, it is the responsibility of the Sri Lankan Government and myself, as the Minister of Education, to empower you all.

This book is a product of free education. Your aim must be to use this book properly and acquire the necessary knowledge out of it. The government in turn is able to provide free textbooks to you, as a result of the commitment and labour of your parents and elders.

Since we have understood that the education is crucial in deciding the future of a country, the government has taken steps to change curriculum to suit the rapid changes of the technological world. Hence , you have to dedicate yourselves to become productive citizens. I believe that the knowledge this book provides will suffice your aim.

It is your duty to give a proper value to the money spent by the government on your education . Also you should understand that education determines your future. Make sure that you reach the optimum social stratum through education.

I congratulate you to enjoy that benefits of free education and bloom as an honoured citizen who takes the name of Sri Lanka to the world.

Akila Viraj KariyawasamMinister of Education

Some words from Amali’s letter cannot be read. Can you write them againsttheir present tense form.

Dear Meena,

Thank you for the New Year greeting card. I received it

yesterday.

We had a very exciting New Years Day this time. Our uncle

working in Dubai came home this year. He brought presents

for everyone.

My mother prepared a lot of sweet meats like kevum,

kokis,aluwa and dodol for us to eat. We shared these sweet

meats with our neighbours. We wore new clothes and

worshipped our elders. We went to the temple in the

morning. In the afternoon we played games.
