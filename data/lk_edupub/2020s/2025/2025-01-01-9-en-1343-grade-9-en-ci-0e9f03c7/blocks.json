There, you had a chance to study more information about nature, tasks and the important role played by family. Accordingly, family renders a special task for the establishment of social security. The basic training of adjusting an individual to the society is given in the family. Discipline and accepted behaviours, activities, role models and attitudes among members in a family help create a responsible individual. The responsibility of a family is to provide a disciplined and cultured individual to society. Nutrition, security, love, compassion, mercy, kindness and models received by an individual, as a member of a family help produce confident, balanced individual to society. This ensures protection and security too. In living together as members of a family, common feelings are developed and they directly contribute to the social security too.",

You can borrow money from parents or friends. If you are used to credit cards or to borrow on interest, the problems will aggravate and will never be able to get rid of it. Planned or systematic management raises the efficiency and productivity of the institution, whereby the employer is benefited. It paves the way for a successful personal life.
