Message of the Boards of Writers and Editors

This textbook has been compiled in accordance with the new syllabus which is to be implemented from 2016 for the use of grade seven students.

We made an effort to develop the attitude “We can master the subject of Mathematics well” in students.

In compiling this textbook, the necessity of developing the basic foundation of studying mathematical concepts in a formal manner was specially considered. This textbook is not just a learning tool which targets the tests held at school. It was compiled granting due consideration to it as a medium that develops logical thinking, correct vision and creativity in the child.

Furthermore, most of the activities, examples and exercises that are incorporated here are related to day to day experiences in order to establish mathematical concepts in the child. This will convince the child about the importance of mathematics in his or her daily life. Teachers who guide the children to utilize this textbook can prepare learning tools that suit the learning style and the level of the child based on the information provided here.

Learning outcomes are presented at the beginning of each lesson. A summary is provided at the end of each lesson to enable the child to revise the important facts relevant to the lesson. Furthermore, at the end of the set of lessons related to each term, a revision exercise has been provided to revise the tasks completed during that term.

Every child does not have the same capability in understanding mathematical concepts. Thus, it is necessary to direct the child from the known to the unknown according to his / her capabilities. We strongly believe that it can be carried out precisely by a professional teacher.

In the learning process, the child should be given ample time to think and practice problems on his or her own. Furthermore, opportunities should be given to practice Mathematics without restricting the child to just the theoretical knowledge provided by mathematics.

Our firm wish is that our children act as intelligent citizens who think logically by studying Mathematics with dedication.

13 Mass

By studying this lesson you will be able to ² identify milligramme as a unit used to measure masses, ² identify the relationship between the units gramme and milligramme, ² add and subtract masses expressed in grammes and milligrammes, and ² multiply and divide masses expressed in milligrammes, grammes, and kilogrammes by a whole number.

13.1 Units used to measure mass

You have learnt before that gramme and kilogramme are units used to measure masses. Now let us identify another unit which is used to measure masses.

The masses of the nutrients included in a 100 grammes packet of food for children, “Thriposha”, are indicated as below.

Protein 20'0 g Carbohydrate 61'9 g

Fat 7'8 g Iron 18 mg

500 mg500 mgThe mass of paracetamol in each of the paracetamol tablets shown in the figure is indicated as 500 mg.

Based on the above information, you will notice that in addition to kilogramme (kg) and gramme (g), the unit milligramme which is smaller than the other two units is also used to measure a mass more precisely. “Milligramme” is denoted by mg.

1 gramme is 1000 milligrammes. That is, 1 g = 1000 mg

For Free Distribution2

13.2 The relationship between grammes and milligrammes

² Expressing a mass given in grammes in milligrammes

Now let us consider how a mass given in grammes is expressed in milligrammes.Since 1 g = 1000 mg, 2 g = 2 × 1000 mg = 2000 mg

3 g = 3 × 1000 mg = 3000 mg

Therefore, to express a mass given in grammes, in terms of milligrammes, the given number of grammes should be multiplied by 1000.

Example 1

Express 7.656 g in milligrammes.7.656 g = 7.656 × 1000 mg = 7656 mg

Example 2

Express 2 g 650 mg in milligrammes.2 g 650 mg = 2 × 1000 mg + 650 mg = 2000 mg + 650 mg = 2650 mgExample 3Example 4Express 7.656 g in grammes and milligrammes.7'656 g = 7 g + 0'656 g = 7 g + 0'656 × 1000 mg = 7 g + 656 mg = 7 g 656 mg

Express 13 2 g in milligrammes.

13 2 g = 3 g + 1 2 g = 3 × 1000 mg + 500 mg = 3000 mg + 500 mg = 3500 mg

² Expressing a mass given in milligrammes in terms of grammes

Next let us consider how a mass given in milligrammes can be expressed in grammes.Since 1000 mg = 1 g,

2000 mg = 10002000 g = 2 g

3000 mg = 10003000 g = 3 g

For Free Distribution3

Therefore, to express a mass given in milligrammes in terms of grammes, the given number of milligrammes should be divided by 1000.

Example 2

Express 2225 mg in grammes and milligrammes.2225 mg = 2000 mg + 225 mg

= 20001000 g + 225 mg

= 2 g + 225 mg = 2 g 225 mgAccordingly, when an amount of 1000 mg or more, is expressed in terms of grammes and milligrammes, care should be taken to ensure that the amount of milligrammes written is less than 1000.

Example 1Express 2758 mg in grammes.

2758 mg = 27581000 g

= 2.758 g

Example 3

Express 3 g 675 mg in grammes.3 g 675 mg = 3 g + 675 mg

= 3 g + 675 1000 g

= 3 g + 0.675 g = 3.675 g

13.3 Addition of masses expressed in grammes and milligrammes

The mass of the chocolates in a box of mass 15 g 350 mg, is 750 g 800 mg. Let us find the total mass of the box of chocolates.To do this, let us add the mass of the box and the mass of the chocolates.

g mg 15 350 750 800 766 150

Let us add the quantities in the milligrammes column.350 mg + 800 mg = 1150 mg1150 mg = 1000 mg + 150 mg = 1 g + 150 mgLet us write 150 mg in the milligrammes column.

Let us carry the 1 g to the grammes column and add the amounts in the grammes column. 1 g + 15 g + 750 g = 766 gLet us write 766 g, in the grammes column.

Method I

Total mass of the box of chocolates is 766 g 150 mg.

13.4 Subtraction of masses expressed in grammes and milligrammes

The total mass of a box of sweetmeats is 500 g 250 mg. The mass of the empty box is 100 g 750 mg. Accordingly, let us find the mass of the sweetmeats in the box.

To find the mass of the sweetmeats, the mass of the empty box needs to be subtracted from the total mass.

-

g mg 500 250100 750399 5 0 0

Since 750 mg cannot be subtracted from 250 mg, let us carry 1 g, that is 1000 mg, from the 500 g in the grammes column to the milligrammes column and add it to the 250 mg in the milligrammes column.Then, 1000 mg + 250 mg = 1250 mg' 1250 mg - 750 mg = 500 mg Let us write the 500 mg in the milligrammes column.Let us subtract 100 g from the 499 g remaining in the grammes column.Then, 499 g - 100 g = 399 g Let us write the 399 g, in the grammes column.

Find the mass of the gold that was used to make the jewellery.

13.5 Multiplication of a mass by a whole number ¾ The mass of gold used to produce a particular pendent is 6 g 500 mg. Let us find the total mass of gold required to produce 5 such pendants.

To produce 5 pendants, 5 portions of gold of mass 6 g 500 mg each are required. Therefore, to find the total mass of gold that is required, 6 g 500 mg should be multiplied by 5.

For Free Distribution7

Method I Let us express 6 g 500 mg in milligrammes and then multiple by 5.

6 g 500 mg = 6500 mg

6500 mg × 5 = 32 500 mg mg 6500 ×5 32 500

32 500 mg = 32 g 500 mg

That is, the total mass required to produce 5 pendants is 32 g 500 mg.

Method II First, let us multiply 500 mg by 5. 500 × 5 mg = 2500 mg 2500 mg = 2000 mg + 500 mg = 2 g + 500 mg Let us write 500 mg in the milligrammes column.

Let us multiply 6 g by 5. 6 g × 5 = 30 g Now let us add the 2 g obtained from the multiplication done in the milligrammes column, to 30 g.30 g + 2 g = 32 gLet us write 32 g in the grammes column.

Example 1

The mass of a lorry which transports goods is 2250 kg. It is loaded with 60 cement bags of mass 50 kg each. When entering an old bridge, the driver sees a notice which indicates that a mass greater than 5300 kg cannot be transported across the bridge. The mass of the driver and his assistant is 140 kg. Is this vehicle allowed to cross the bridge? Mass of vehicle = 2250 kg Mass of cement = 50 kg × 60 = 3000 kgMass of two passengers = 140 kg Therefore the total mass of the vehicle = 2250 kg + 3000 kg + 140 kg = 5390 kg Since the total mass of the vehicle is more than 5300 kg, it is not allowed to cross the bridge.

13.6 Division of a mass by a whole number

¾ The mass of 5 tablets is 1 g 750 mg. Let us find the mass of one tablet. To do this, 1 g 750 mg should be divided by 5.

Let us divide the gramme quantity first. Since there are no 5s in 1, let us write ‘0’ in the place where the answer is to be written in the grammes column and carry the remaining 1 g as 1000 mg to the milligrammes column.

Then let us find the amount of milligrammes in the milligrammes column. 1000 mg + 750 mg = 1750 mg Let us divide 1750 mg by 5. 1750 mg ÷ 5 = 350 mg

14 Rectilinear plane figures (Part I)

By studying this lesson you will be able to ² identify what a polygon is and ² identify convex polygons, concave polygons and regular polygons.

14.1 PolygonsConsider each of the following plane figures.

The above figures are all bounded by straight line segments. Furthermore, the straight line segments do not intersect each other in these plane figures, and only two straight line segments meet at each vertex point. Such plane figures are called polygons.

A closed plane figure bounded by three or more straight line segments is called a polygon.

Each of the line segments by which a given polygon is bounded is called a side of the polygon and each of the points at which two of these sides meet is called a vertex of the polygon.

AB

C

The region bounded by the straight line segments of a polygon (shaded blue) is called the interior region of the polygon, and the region outside (shaded pink) is called the exterior region of the polygon.

For Free Distribution15

A is a point in the interior region of the polygon, B is a point on the polygon and C is a point in the exterior region of the polygon.

An angle in the interior region of a given polygon, between two sides which meet at a vertex is called an angle of the polygon.

(a)(b)

Figure (a) shown here has three straight lines which meet at a particular point. Figure (b) has two straight lines which intersect at a point. Therefore, these plane figures are not polygons.

A polygon should have at least three sides. Polygons with three sides are triangles. Polygons with 4 sides are quadrilaterals, polygons with 5 sides are pentagons and polygons with 6 sides are hexagons.

No angle of a convex polygon is a reflex angle.

At least one angle of a concave polygon is a reflex angle.

14.3 Regular polygons

A polygon with all sides equal in length and all angles equal in magnitude is called a regular polygon.

² A triangle with all three sides equal in length and all three angles equal in magnitude is a regular triangle or an equilateral triangle.

² A quadrilateral with all four sides equal in length and all four angles equal in magnitude is a regular quadrilateral or a square.

² A pentagon with all five sides equal in length and all five angles equal in magnitude is a regular pentagon.

² A hexagon with all six sides equal in length and all six angles equal in magnitude is a regular hexagon.

There are polygons with all sides equal in length, which are not regular polygons.

For example, in a rhombus, all four sides are equal in length, but all four angles are not equal in magnitude. Therefore a rhombus is not a regular polygon.

There are polygons with all angles equal in magnitude, which are not regular polygons.

15 Equations and Formulae

By studying this lesson you will be able to ² construct a simple equation in one unknown, ² solve simple equations, ² construct simple formulae, and ² find the value of any variable of a formula by substituting positive whole numbers for the other variables.

15.1 Constructing simple equations

x + 3 2x - 7 3x

You have learnt earlier to construct algebraic expressions by using algebraic symbols for unknown values, numbers for known values and operations.

x + 3 = 10 2x - 7 = 183x = 9

When the value represented by an algebraic expression is equal to the value of a given number, it can be expressed as “algebraic expression = number”.

When the value represented by an algebraic expression is equal to the value represented by another algebraic expression, it can be expressed as “first algebraic expression = second algebraic expression”.

Relationships of the above forms are called equations.

Consider the equations x + 3 = 10" 2x - 7 = 18 and 3x = 9' There is only one unknown in each of these equations. The index of the unknown in each equation is also 1.

An equation containing only one unknown of index one is called a simple equation.

In the equation x + 5 = 8, the value of the algebraic expression x + 5 on the left-hand side has been equated to 8 on the right-hand side.

For Free Distribution27

An equation always contains the symbol “=”. Apart from this, it also contains unknown terms, numbers and operations.

² A vendor had x mangoes. He bought another 24 mangoes. He now has a total of 114 mangoes. Let us express this information by an equation.

The number of mangoes the vendor had initially = xThe number of mangoes the vendor bought = 24The total number of mangoes the vendor has now = x + 24Moreover, since the total number of mangoes the vendor has now is 114, x + 24 = 114

r

² “The price of a loaf of bread reduced by 4 rupees. The new price of a loaf of bread is 50 rupees.” Let us express this by an equation. Let us take the initial price of a loaf of bread as b rupees. Since the price of a loaf of bread reduced by 4 rupees, the new price of a loaf of bread = b - 4Moreover, since the new price of a loaf of bread is 50 rupees, b - 4 = 50

² Books have been placed on the shelves of a bookcase in a library such that each shelf contains x books. There are 6 shelves in the bookcase. After 10 of these books were issued to students, the number of books remaining in the bookcase reduced to 104. Let us express this information by an equation.

The total number of books that were on the 6 shelves = 6 x Number of books issued to students = 10 ∴ the number of books remaining in the bookcase = 6 x - 10Moreover, since the number of books remaining is 104, 6x - 10 = 104

When 13 is added to twice the value of a given number, the value that is obtained is 85. Represent this information by an equation.Let us take the number as a.Twice this number = 2 × a = 2a The number that is added = 13 The number that is obtained = 2a + 13Moreover, since the number that is obtained is 85, 2a + 13 = 85

(xiv) Sameera needed to buy a book worth 500 rupees. He saved an equal amount of money each day for 7 days. To purchase the book, he needed to add another 129 rupees to the amount he had saved.15.2 Solving simple equations

The equality symbol “=” in an equation expresses the fact that the value represented on the left-hand side of the symbol is equal to the value represented on the right-hand side.

What we mean by solving a simple equation is finding the value of the unknown term which satisfies the equation (that is, the value for which the equation holds true). This value is called the solution of the equation. A simple equation has only one solution.

x + 3 = 7 x ?

For example, when 4 is substituted for x in the equation x + 3 = 7, the left-hand side of the equation is equal to the right-hand side.

Therefore, the solution to the equation x + 3 = 7 is x = 4'

² Solving simple equations using algebraic methods

You have learnt that the equality symbol “=” in an equation expresses the fact that the value on the left-hand side of this symbol is equal to the value on the right-hand side.

When solving simple equations, the value that the unknown should take for the left-hand side to be equal to the right-hand side of the equation can be found as follows.

¾ Let us find the value of the unknown which satisfies the equation a + 8 = 10.

When the same number is subtracted from the two sides of an equation, the new values that are obtained on the two sides are equal.

Let us subtract 8 from both sides of the equation a + 8 = 10.a + 8 - 8 = 10 - 8 (8 - 8 = 0)∴ a = 2

¾ Let us find the value of the unknown which satisfies the equation x - 7 = 10.In this equation, the value of x - 7 is equal to 10.

When the same number is added to the two sides of an equation, the new values that are obtained on the two sides are equal.

When 7 is added to the two sides of the equation x - 7 = 10, the left-hand side is equal to x and the right-hand side is equal to 17.

x - 7 + 7 = 10 + 7 (- 7 + 7 = 0)∴ x = 17

For Free Distribution31

¾ Let us solve the equation 5x = 10.

When the two sides of an equation are divided by the same non-zero number, the new values that are obtained on the two sides are equal.

Let us divide both sides of the equation 5x = 10 by 5.

5x

5 = 10

5 ( 5 5 = 1)∴ x = 2

When the value that is obtained is substituted for the unknown in the equation and simplified, if the same number is obtained on the two sides of the equation, then the accuracy of your answer is established.

Let us establish this, through the following examples.

Solve 3y - 2 = 10.3y - 2 = 10 3y - 2 + 2 = 10 + 2 (let us add 2 to both sides) (- 2 + 2 = 0)3y = 12 3y

3 = 12

3 ^let us divide both sides by 3& ( 33 = 1)

∴ y = 4

Let us examine whether the solution y = 4 that you obtained is correct.When y = 4, Left-hand side = 3y - 2 = 3 × 4 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 Right-hand side = 10 Therefore, left-hand side = right-hand sideTherefore, the solution y = 4 is correct.

Example 1

For Free Distribution32

It costs 96 rupees to buy four books of the same price and 3 pencils priced at 8 rupees each. Find the price of a book.Let us take the price of a book as x rupees. Then the price of four books = 4x rupees The price of 3 pencils, each priced at 8 rupees = 3 × 8 rupees = 24 rupees

Example 2

Therefore" 4x + 24 = 96 4x + 24 - 24 = 96 - 24 4x = 724x 4 = 72 4x = 18

∴ the price of a book is 18 rupees.

Let us examine whether the solution x = 18 is correct.When x = 18, Left-hand side = 4x + 24 = 4 × 18 + 24 = 72 + 24 = 96 Right-hand side = 96 That is, left-hand side = right-hand side∴ the solution x = 18 is correct.

² Another method of solving simple equations

The inverse operations of the mathematical operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division which we use in equations are respectively subtraction, addition, division and multiplication. Another method of solving a simple equation of the above form is performing the inverse operations of the operations on the left-hand side, on the value on the right-hand side.

By studying this lesson you will be able to ² add and subtract length measurements, ² multiply and divide length measurements by a whole number, and ² find the perimeter of a rectilinear plane figure.

16.1 Units of length All the words, height, depth, width and thickness describe a certain length. You have already learnt that the units millimetre (mm), centimetre (cm), metre (m) and kilometre (km) are used to measure lengths. The relationships between these units are given below.

1 cm = 10 mm 1 m = 100 cm1 km = 1000 m

1 centimetre = 10 millimetres 1metre = 100 centimetres 1 kilometre = 1000 metres

You have also learnt to convert a length given in a certain unit to another unit using the above relationships. Do the following review exercise to revise what you have learnt.

16.3 Subtraction of lengths

² The length of a classroom wall is 5 m 50 cm. It has been decided to draw a picture along the top edge of the wall. On a particular day, the picture is drawn to a length of 1 m 80 cm. Let us find the remaining length of the wall on which the picture needs to be drawn.

For Free Distribution41

To do this we need to subtract the length of the picture drawn from the length of the entire wall.Method I

5 m 50 cm = 5' 50 m 1 m 80 cm = 1' 80 m5 m 50 cm − 1 m 80 cm = 3'70 m = 3 m 70 cm So the length of the wall remaining on which the picture has to be drawn is 3 m 70 cm.

50 is less than 80. So let us carry over 1 m from the 5 m in the metres column to the centimetres column. Then 4 m will remain in the metres column. 100 cm + 50 cm = 150 cm 150 cm − 80 cm = 70 cmLet us write 70 cm in the centimetres column.Now let us reduce 1 m from the 4 m in the metres column.4 m − 1 m = 3 mLet us write 3 m in the metres column.

16.4 Multiplication and division of measurements of length

●Multiplication of a measurement of length by a whole number

¾ A ribbon of length 1 m 80 cm is required to decorate a present. Let us find the length of ribbon required to decorate 8 presents.

To do this, we need a ribbon which is of length eight times that of the piece of ribbon that is required to decorate one present. So 1 m 80 cm must be multiplied by 8.

80 cm × 8 = 640 cm Since 640 cm = 6 m 40 cm, let us write the 40 cm in the centimetres column and carry the 6 m to the metres column. 1 m × 8 = 8 m. Let us add the 8 m to the 6 m. 8 m + 6 m = 14 mLet us write the 14 m, in the metres column.

The area of the rectangle = length × breadth ... The area of the rectangle = l × b square units

If the area of a rectangle of length l units and breadth b units is A square units, then A = lb.

18 Circles

By studying this lesson you will be able to ² draw circles by handling a pair of compasses accurately, ² identify what the centre, radius and diameter of a circle are, and ² create circle designs using a pair of compasses.

18.1 Drawing Circles

You are already capable of drawing circles and creating circle designs using different objects with circular shapes. Observe the figures given below to recall what you have learnt earlier on this subject.

A figure drawn using a tumbler is shown here. You have learnt that the entire curved line of the figure is called a circle.

B

In this figure, A is a point on the circle, B is a point inside the circle and C is a point outside the circle.

When circles are drawn using various objects, the size of each circle drawn depends on the size of the circular shape of the object used to draw the circle. Therefore the above method is not suitable to draw a circle of the size of your choice. Let us investigate other methods of drawing circles without using objects with circular shapes. Let us do Activity 1.

Activity 1

Get two sticks and a thread. Step 1 - Fix one stick in the middle of a flat sandy land and tie a thread of a particular length to the stick as shown in the figure. Step 2 - Tie the other end of the thread to another stick.

Step 3 - Mark a curved line on the sand by keeping one end of the second stick in contact with the sandy land while moving right around the stick fixed in the middle of the flat land, ensuring that the thread is tightly stretched at all times. Step 4 - Repeat the above activity several times using threads of different lengths.

Get tw

You will realize that the size of the circle depends on the length of the thread that is used.

There is a tool called “a pair of compasses” in the mathematical instruments box which can be used instead of the two sticks and the piece of thread, to do the above activity. Different lengths can be obtained using a pair of compasses, as was achieved above by using pieces of thread of different lengths.

Now let us do the above activity using the pair of compasses. When you are preparing the pair of compasses, it is convenient to use a short pencil. The pencil should be fixed such that the point of the pencil and the point of the pair of compasses are at the same level when the pair of compasses is fully compressed.

Step 1 - Mark a point called O towards the centre of the white paper.

Step 2 - Adjust the pair of compasses such that the distance between the pencil point and the point of the pair of compasses is 2 cm.

Step 3 - Keep the point of the pair of compasses fixed at O and draw a curved line on the piece of paper by moving the pencil point one whole round about the point O, while ensuring that the distance between the pencil point and the point of the pair of compasses remains unchanged. You will see that a circle is drawn around point O.

Step 4 - Construct several other circles by changing the distance between the point of the pair of compasses and the pencil point.

19.2 Measuring the volume of solid objects using arbitrary units

By comparing the amount of space occupied by a die with the amount of space occupied by a brick, we can easily say that the volume of the brick is greater than the volume of the die.

However, it is difficult to compare the volumes of objects such as statues and logs which are of different shapes by just observing them. Therefore let us consider the units that are used to measure volumes.

The unit to measure area is 1 square unit which is the area of a square of side length 1 unit.

since there are 8 cubes in figure (a), the volume of the cuboid in figure (a) is 8 cubic units,

since there are 8 cubes in figure (b), the volume of the cuboid in figure (b) is 8 cubic units, and

² More on measuring the volume of solid objects using arbitrary units

Consider how the volume of the cuboid shown below has been found.

(a)

Here the cuboid has been divided into 12 smaller cubes of side length 1 unit. Let us take the volume of one small cube to be 1 cubic unit. Then the volume of the cuboid is 12 cubic units.

(b)

Here the cuboid has been divided into 96 small cubes of side length 1 unit. Let us take the volume of one small cube to be 1 cubic unit. Then the volume of this cuboid is 96 cubic units.

Understand that the volume of the small cube that we used as our unit to measure volume is different in the above two cases. Accordingly, two different numerical values were obtained for the volume of the cuboid.

As indicated above, an arbitrary unit can be used to measure the volume of a solid object. It is important to mention the unit that was used when writing the volume of an object, as the numerical value depends on the unit used, as seen above.

19.3 Standard units used to measure volume

We obtained different numerical values for the volume of a solid object, which depended on the unit that was used. To avoid this variance, standard units are used to measure volumes.

A quantity of one litre of a liquid is equal to a quantity of 1000 millilitres of that liquid. 1 l = 1000 ml

To express a liquid quantity in millilitres, which is given in litres, the quantity given in litres should be multiplied by 1000.

To express a liquid quantity in litres, which is given in millilitres, the quantity given in millilitres should be divided by 1000.

21 Ratios

By studying this lesson you will be able to ² divide a quantity in a given ratio, ² find the total value or the values of the other terms when the value of a term of a ratio is given, and ² apply knowledge on ratios in practical situations.

21.1 Ratios and Equivalent Ratios

You have learnt in grade six that a ratio is a numerical relationship between two or more quantities expressed in similar units.

Let us focus on a few instances in daily life where ratios are applied.

A label pasted on a bottle of fruit juice recommends that, two parts juice be mixed with three parts water.

Fruit juiceWater

1 l1 l1 l1 l1 l

Therefore, to make a consumable drink from the bottled juice, one can mix 2 litres of juice with 3 litres of water.

We say that the fruit drink is made using juice and water in the ratio 2:3.

The mixed quantities (in litres) of juice and water are expressed by the ratio 2:3. This is read as ‘two-to-three’ or ‘two-is-to-three’. The numbers 2 and 3 are called the terms of the ratio.

When we write a ratio, it is essential to write the terms in the correct order – that is, the order in which we mention the quantities. In the above example, we wrote juice first and water second. The same order is followed for the terms – we write 2 as the first term of the ratio and 3 as the second term.

For Free Distribution92

When the terms of a given ratio are multiplied by the same positive whole number, we get an equivalent ratio.

That is, 1 : 3 = 2 : 6 = 3 : 9 = 4 : 12 = 5 : 15'

Now let us consider an example where three items are mixed.A concrete mixture is made by mixing together cement, sand and granite.

Sand

Cement

Granite

The ratio in which cement, sand and granite are mixed to prepare this concrete mixture is written as 1 : 3 : 4. It is read ‘1 to 3 to 4’ or ‘1 is to 3 is to 4’. Here, 1, 3 and 4 are the terms of the ratio.

Let us multiply each term of the ratio 1 : 3 : 4 by 2.Then we get the ratio 2 : 6 : 8. The ratio 2 : 6 : 8 is equivalent to the ratio 1 : 3 : 4.

A ratio should be written such that its terms are whole numbers that cannot be simplified further.

If the terms of a given ratio are whole numbers, and if the highest common factor of the terms is 1, then the ratio is said to be in the simplest form.

When the terms of a ratio are whole numbers, to write the ratio in its simplest form,

$ check whether the terms have common factors.

$ if the terms have common factors, then divide each term of the ratio by the highest common factor of the terms.

Example 2

Express the ratio 8 : 4 : 12 in its simplest form. The HCF of the terms 8, 4 and 12 is 4. Dividing the terms of the ratio by 4 we obtain,8 : 4 : 12 = 8 ÷ 4 : 4 ÷ 4 : 12 ÷ 4 = 2 : 1 : 3

The sides of a triangle are 8 cm, 6 cm 5 mm and 50 mm. Find the ratio of the lengths of the sides of the triangle and express it in the simplest form.Let us express the lengths in similar units.8 cm = 80 mm, 6 cm 5 mm = 65 mm, 50 mmThe ratio of the lengths of the sides = 80 : 65 : 50The ratio of the lengths of the sides } = 16 : 13 : 10 in the simplest form

21.2 Dividing in a ratio

² Dividing a given quantity in a ratio

There are instances in day-to-day life when people need to divide items among themselves. On some occasions, this is done in equal amounts, while on other occasions it is done in unequal amounts. At the beginning of this lesson, we discussed about mixing juice and water in the ratio 2:3.

Five units of fruit drink are made by mixing 2 parts juice with 3 parts water.

The ingredients of this drink are juice and water.

Since the number of parts of juice is 2 and the number of parts of water is 3, the number of parts of drink is 5.

Let us find the amount of each ingredient in the drink, if 10 litres of the drink were made.

●Multiplying (or dividing) the terms of a given ratio by a fixed number gives an equivalent ratio.

●If all the terms of a ratio are whole numbers and their HCF is one, the ratio is said to be in its simplest form.

●The total number of parts of a ratio is the sum of the terms of the ratio. The number of parts of each item is the term in the ratio associated with that item.

For example, a concrete mixture in which cement, sand and granite are mixed in the ratio 3 : 6 : 8 has 3 parts of cement, 6 parts of sand and 8 parts of granite. Thus, the total number of parts is 17.

●When ingredients are mixed in a given ratio, if the amount of one ingredient or the total amount is known, it is possible to find the amount of a single part, by dividing the known amount by the relevant number of parts.

Let us study percentages using a 10 × 10 square grid.

The region of the 10 × 10 square grid is taken as 1 unit.

Considering it as one unit, the grid is divided into 100 small squares. Of these squares, exactly one is coloured. That is, 1100 of the entire grid is coloured. As a percentage,

this is 1%. This is read as “one percent”. This indicates a portion of a unit as a percentage.

22.2 More on representing fractions as percentages

Let us now consider a fraction which does not have 100 as the denominator. Let us learn to write it as a percentage.

Observe this figure. We see that 14 of the whole figure is coloured'

This figure has been divided into 100 equal sized squares.Here 25100 of the whole figure is coloured. That is 25% of the whole figure is coloured.

See that the coloured parts of both figures are the same. So 14 = 25100 ' That is 14 = 25%'

Thus, a given fraction can be written as an equivalent fraction with 100 as the denominator. Then we can represent the given fraction as a percentage.

Accordingly, with respect to the point X, the positions of the points A, B and C can be represented by the numbers 1, 4 and - 2 r espectively.

Points A and B are located to the right of point X, at a distance of 1 unit and 4 units respectively from X. Point C is located to the left of point X, at a distance of 2 units from X.

There are many points on a plane which are at a distance of 1 unit from a fixed point on the plane. Therefore, it is not possible to exactly determine the location of a point at a distance of 1 unit from a particular point on a plane, using only one number line.

Rene Descartes

In 1637, Rene Descartes (1596 AD – 1650 AD) of French origin presented a method of representing the exact location of a point on a plane using a grid. Such a grid is called a Cartesian plane.

² Any point on the plane can be exactly identified by two numbers based on point O.

² These two numbers are called the coordinates of that point.

The line drawn from point A which is perpendicular to the x - axis, meets the x - axis at 3. The line drawn from point A which is perpendicular to the y - axis, meets the y-axis at 4.

Accordingly, the x - coordinate of the point A is defined as 3 and the y - coordinate of A is defined as 4. The coordinates of A are written as (3, 4) by writing the x - coordinate first and the y-coordinate second, within brackets. This is written in short as A(3,4).

By studying this lesson you will be able to ² construct a straight line segment of given length, ² construct an equilateral triangle of given side length, and ² construct a hexagon by means of an equilateral triangle or a circle.

24.1 Constructions

The following figure presents examples of equilateral triangles and regular hexagons that can be observed around us.

Equilateral triangles and regular hexagons are two types of convex polygons that are important in geometry.

In geometry, it is necessary to draw as well as construct plane figures. When a plane figure is being drawn, it is done according to the given data, without paying much attention to the measurements. However, when a plane figure is being constructed, attention needs to be paid to the measurements, and a figure of the correct size should be constructed according to the given data.

Geometrical constructions are done with a pair of compasses and a straight edge. When it is necessary to measure lengths and angles, then the appropriate measuring instruments need to be used.

After completing the table, turn your attention to the (V + F) column and the“E” column. With regard to the above solids, notice that the values in the (V + F) column are always greater by 2 than the values in the“E” column.

Accordingly, for the above solids, the sum of the number of faces and the number of vertices is equal to the value obtained by adding 2 to the number of edges.

Number of Vertices + Number of Faces = Number of Edges + 2 V + F = E + 2

The above relationship which is true for solids with plane faces only, was first presented in the 18th century by a Swiss mathematician called “Leonhard Euler” who lived in Switzerland. Therefore this relationship was later called Euler’s formula.

Exercise 25.2

(1) A certain solid has 6 faces and 8 vertices. Find the number of edges of the solid using Euler’s relationship.

Construct a composite solid by pasting the square faces of the 6 pyramids on the six faces of the cube. (i) How many edges, faces and vertices are there in the composite solid?(ii) Do these values agree with Euler’s relationship?

●A solid that consists of a square base and 4 identical triangular faces having a common vertex is called a square pyramid. ●A square pyramid consists of 8 edges, 5 faces and 5 vertices. ●A solid with 3 rectangular faces and 2 parallel triangular faces is called a triangular prism. ●A triangular prism consists of 9 edges, 5 faces and 6 vertices. ●If a solid has E number of edges, F number of faces and V number of vertices, V + F = E + 2 denotes Euler’s relationship.

27 Scale Diagrams

By studying this lesson you will be able to ² identify scale diagrams, and ² draw scale diagrams and calculate actual measurements using the scale.

27.1 Scale Diagrams

When the shapes of various objects in the environment are being drawn, it is most often difficult to draw them to the actual measurements of the shape. In such situations, the shape is drawn by decreasing or increasing the measurements by a common ratio depending on the size of the shape.

Since the figure is drawn by increasing or decreasing all the measurements by a common ratio, the shape of the figure will be exactly the same as the original shape and only the size will be different. Figures drawn in this manner are called scale diagrams. A few such scale diagrams are shown below.

27.2 The Scale of a Scale Diagram Suppose you want to draw a scale diagram of a flower bed of length 6 m and breadth 2 m in your book. You need to first select a suitable scale.

Suppose 1 cm in the scale diagram represents a length of 1 m of the flower bed.

Since 1 m equals 100 cm, a length of 1 cm in the scale diagram represents 100 cm of actual length. As the same unit has been used, this can be expressed as a ratio as 1:100. This ratio is considered as the scale of the scale diagram.

Based on the selected scale, a scale diagram of the flower bed can be drawn, with the actual length of the flower bed which is 6 m represented by 6 cm and the actual breadth which is 2 m represented by 2 cm in the scale diagram.

6 cm

2 cm

Scale 1: 100

The scale written as 1:100 in the figure expresses the fact that an actual length of 100 cm is represented by 1 cm in the scale diagram.

27.4 Obtaining actual measurements from scale diagrams

Let us see how the actual measurements can be obtained from a given scale diagram by considering a few examples.

A scale diagram of a land drawn to the scale 1:500 is shown in the figure. Let us find; 6 cm

2 cm(i) the actual length of the land,(ii) the actual width of the land,(iii) the actual area of the land.The scale 1:500 indicates that 500 cm or 5m of the actual length of the land is represented by 1 cm in the scale diagram. Therefore; (i) the actual length of the land = 6 × 5 m = 30 m(ii) the actual width of the land = 2 × 5 m = 10 m (iii) the actual area of the land = length × width = 30 × 10 m2 = 300 m2

Example 1A square shaped land is drawn to the scale 1: 400. The side length of the scale drawing is 2.5 cm. Calculate the side length of the land.1 : 400 means that 400 cm or 4 m is represented by 1 cm in the scale diagram.

Therefore" side length of the land = 2.5 × 4 m = 10 m Example 2 What length in a scale diagram drawn to the scale 1: 10 000 represents an actual length of 1 km?

1:10 000 means that 10 000 cm is represented by 1 cm in the scale diagram.10 000 cm = 100 m = 0.1 kmThat is, 0.1 km is represented by 1 cm in the scale diagram.∴ 1 km is represented by 10 cm in the scale diagram.

28.1 Introducing Tessellation

Figures of surfaces which are attractive due to a certain shape occurring repeatedly in an organized manner are given below. Each of these creations enhances the beauty of the environment.

The fact that the shape that recurs is of one size and the shapes are organized in a pattern without any gaps in between them reveals the wonder of nature. Let us consider such creations further.

We have seen how bricks and tiles have been laid in attractive designs on the floors, roofs and courtyards of places of worship. Moreover, most bed spreads and clothes have beautiful designs on them. Several such designs are shown below. See whether you can identify the shapes in them.

Tessellation is the process of creating a design consisting of the repeated use of one or more shapes, closely fitted together without gaps or overlaps, on a plane surface.

Based on this description, we can identify the creations in the above figures as tessellations.

Step 1 - Create a design by repeatedly drawing the shape in this figure on a page in your square ruled exercise book.

Step 2 - Colour your design appropriately and make it an attractive work of art.

Tessellation that is done using two or more different shapes is called semi pure tessellation.

PThe figure shows a tessellation that has been created using squares. A point at which vertices of several of these squares meet has been marked as P. As depicted in the figure, the angles of four squares are around the point P. Let us consider the sum of the angles around the point P.

The magnitude of an interior angle of the square = 90o

∴ the sum of the angles around the point P = 90o × 4 = 360oWe can similarly show that the sum of the angles around any point is equal to 360o.

The sum of the angles around a vertex point of a tessellation created using rectilinear plane figures is 360o.

29 Likelihood of an Event Occurring

By studying this lesson you will be able to ² identify the events that definitely occur, the events that definitely do not occur and the event that occur randomly and ² describe the outcomes of an experiment.

29.1 Events Let us consider the following events. 1. A stone which is lifted and released, falling downwards 2. The sun rising from the West 3. A tossed coin landing heads up 4. The next page turned in a Mathematics book being a whole numbered page 5. The cricketer getting out in the next ball 6. Appearance of the moon on a new-moon day 7. The sun rising tomorrow 8. Rain occurring this afternoon 9. A heavy stone floating on water10. A train leaving at the scheduled time

Now let us divide these events into the following three types; the events that definitely occur, the events that definitely do not occur and the events which we cannot be certain will occur or not.

We know that the events 1, 4 and 7 will definitely occur. We also know that the events 2, 6 and 9 will definitely not occur. If we consider event 3, we cannot say for certain that a tossed coin will land heads up. Likewise it is not certain whether the events 5, 8 and 10 will occur or not.

For Free Distribution155

So, the events we come across are of three types. They are, events that definitely occur, events that definitely do not occur and events that we cannot be certain will occur or not. The events which we cannot be certain will occur or not are called random events.

29.2 Experiments and Outcomes

The event, “the first commuter getting down from the bus is a woman” is a random event. This is because the first commuter getting down from the bus can be either a woman or a man. Before someone gets down from the bus, we cannot be certain which of these two events will occur. The experiment here is “observing whether the first commuter getting down from the bus is a woman or a man”. The outcome will be either “the commuter is a woman” or “the commuter is a man”.

For the event of “a stone which is lifted and released falling downwards” the relevant experiment is “observing a stone which is lifted and released”. The outcome is “the stone falling downwards”.

Furthermore, in experiments such as observing whether the sun rises from the East and observing whether a stone lifted and released falls downwards, the outcomes are definitely known before the experiment is conducted.

Let us consider the event of “a tossed coin landing tails up”. In this case we cannot be certain whether heads or tails will land up. So the event is a random event. Here, the experiment is “observing the side that lands up when a coin is tossed”. The outcome will be either “heads landing up” or “tails landing up”.

Let us consider the event of “rain occurring this afternoon”. This is a random event. The experiment is “observing whether it rains this afternoon”. The outcome will be either “raining this afternoon” or “not raining this afternoon”.

Example 1The faces of a die are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. The die is rolled once and the number on the face that turns upward is observed. Write the set of outcomes of this experiment.getting 1, getting 2, getting 3, getting 4, getting 5 and getting 6.

29.3 The likelihood of obtaining each of the possible outcomes of an experiment

Let us examine the nature of each of the experiments given below.

¾ The faces of a regular die are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. The die is rolled once and the number on the face that turns upward is observed.

The outcomes of this experiment are getting 1, getting 2, getting 3, getting 4, getting 5 and getting 6. If each of these outcomes is equally likely to occur, then the die used in this experiment is called a “fair die” or an “unbiased die”.

¾ A coin is tossed once and the side that lands up is observed.

The outcomes of this experiment are getting head and getting tail. If either one of these outcomes is equally likely to occur, then the coin used in this experiment is called “a fair coin “or an “unbiased coin”

¾ A coin with one side made of aluminum and the other side of copper, where the quantities of aluminum and copper used are equal, is tossed once and the side that lands up is observed.

The outcomes of this experiment are “the aluminum side lands up” and “the copper side lands up”. Since the density of copper is more than the density of aluminum, the likelihood of the aluminum side landing up is greater than the likelihood of the copper side landing up. Therefore this is not a fair coin.

¾ A coconut shell similar to the one in the figure is tossed once and the side that lands up is observed.

The outcomes of this experiment are “the shell lands up and “the shell lands down. Although there are only two outcomes, the likelihood of landing with the shell up is greater than the likelihood of landing with the shell down. Therefore, the coconut shell is not an unbiased object.

¾ The faces of a regular tetrahedron are numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4. The tetrahedron is rolled once and the number on the face that turns downward is observed.

12

3

The outcomes of this experiment are getting 1, getting 2, getting 3 and getting 4. If each of these is equally likely to occur, then this regular tetrahedron is a fair one.

¾ The faces of a cuboid are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. The cuboid is rolled once and the number on the face that turns upward is observed.

6

15The outcomes of this experiment are getting 1, getting 2, getting 3, getting 4, getting 5 and

For Free Distribution159

getting 6. The areas of the faces of the cuboid are not the same. It is more likely for the cuboid to land with a face having the greatest area downwards. Therefore, of the six outcomes, certain events are more likely to occur than the others. So the cuboid is not a “fair object”.

If each of the outcomes of an experiment is equally likely to occur, then the object used in the experiment is called a fair or an unbiased object.

Summary

²The events which occur in our environment fall into one of the following three types. The events which definitely occur, the events which definitely do not occur and random events. ²The events that can occur in an experiment are called the outcomes of the experiment. ²If an experiment is carried out using an object, the object is considered to be an unbiased object (fair object) if all the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely and it is considered to be a biased object if the outcomes are not equally likely.
