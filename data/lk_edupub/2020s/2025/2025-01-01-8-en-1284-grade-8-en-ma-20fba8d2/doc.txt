Message of the Boards of Writers and Editors

This textbook has been compiled in accordance with the new syllabus which is to be implemented from 2017 for the use of grade eight students.

We made an effort to develop the attitude “We can master the subject of Mathematics well” in students.

In compiling this textbook, the necessity of developing the basic foundation of studying mathematical concepts in a formal manner was specially considered. This textbook is not just a learning tool which targets the tests held at school. It was compiled granting due consideration to it as a medium that develops logical thinking, correct vision and creativity in the child.

Furthermore, most of the activities, examples and exercises that are incorporated here are related to day to day experiences in order to establish mathematical concepts in the child. This will convince the child about the importance of mathematics in his or her daily life. Teachers who guide the children to utilize this textbook can prepare learning tools that suit the learning style and the level of the child based on the information provided here.

Learning outcomes are presented at the beginning of each lesson. A summary is provided at the end of each lesson to enable the child to revise the important facts relevant to the lesson. Furthermore, at the end of the set of lessons related to each term, a revision exercise has been provided to revise the tasks completed during that term.

Every child does not have the same capability in understanding mathematical concepts. Thus, it is necessary to direct the child from the known to the unknown according to his / her capabilities. We strongly believe that it can be carried out precisely by a professional teacher.

In the learning process, the child should be given ample time to think and practice problems on his or her own. Furthermore, opportunities should be given to practice mathematics without restricting the child to just the theoretical knowledge provided by mathematics.

We would like to bestow our sincere thanks on Dr. Jayampathi Rathnayake, Department of Mathematics, University of Colombo, Dr. Anuradha Mahasinghe, Department of Mathematics, University of Colombo and W. K. A. Samanmalee, WP/ JP/ President College, Maharagama.

Our firm wish is that our children act as intelligent citizens who think logically by studying mathematics with dedication.

1 Number Patterns

By studying this lesson you will be able to, • identify the nth term of a given number pattern, and• find any term of a number pattern when the nth term is given.

1.1 Number patterns and terms of a number pattern

3" 5" 7" 9" 11

Let us write the odd numbers from 3 to 11 in ascending order.

3, 5, 7, 9, 11

This is the number pattern of the odd numbers from 3 to 11 written in ascending order.

• When numbers are written in a certain order according to a specific method or rule, starting from a certain number, it is called a number pattern.

• Every number in a given number pattern is called a term of the number pattern.

• The first number of a number pattern is called the first term and the following numbers in order are called the second term, third term, fourth term, etc.

• Commas are used to separate the terms of a number pattern.

Let us consider again the number pattern 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 of the odd numbers from 3 to 11 written in ascending order.

3" 5" 7" 9" 11The first term of the above pattern is 3 and the fourth term is 9. The last or the 5th term is 11. There are only five terms in this number pattern. Therefore the number of terms is finite.

Such number patterns, where the number of terms is finite, are called finite number patterns.

2" 4" 6" 8" '''Let us write the even numbers starting from 2 in ascending order.

2, 4, 6, 8, …

You learnt in Grade 6 that this is the number pattern of the even numbers starting from 2 written in ascending order.

Since the exact number of terms in this number pattern cannot be specified, that is, since it is infinite, we cannot write down all its terms. Therefore, the first few terms are written such that the pattern can be identified, and as above, three dots are used to denote the rest of the terms.

Such number patterns where the number of terms is not finite, are called infinite number patterns.

Example 1

Write the terms of each of the following number patterns.

(i) The number pattern of the prime numbers between 1 and 17, written in ascending order.

(ii) The number pattern of the odd numbers starting from 1, written in ascending order.

(iii) The number pattern starting from 1 and followed by the terms 2 and 1 written alternatively.

ª (i) 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 (ii) 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, …

(iii) 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, …

Note

2" 4" 8" '@'Consider the number pattern 2, 4, 8,…

A number pattern with the first, second and third terms equal to 2, 4 and 8 respectively is given above.

We can easily write two different number patterns with the above first three terms.(i) 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, … Here a term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.(ii) 2, 4, 8, 10, 20, 22, 44, … Here, the second term is obtained by adding two to the first term, the third term is obtained by multiplying the second term by two, the fourth term is obtained by adding two to the third term, etc.

An important fact that can be learnt from this is that there can be more than one number pattern having the same first few terms.

(iii) The number pattern of the even numbers greater than 7 written in ascending order. (iv) The number pattern of the prime numbers starting from 2 written in ascending order.

(3) Copy the below given statements in your exercise book and mark the correct statements with a  and the incorrect statements with a  .(i) The terms of a number pattern have to be in ascending order. (ii) The terms of a number pattern have to be different from each other.(iii) If the 10th terms of two number patterns are different, then the two number patterns are different to each other.

1.2 The general term of a number pattern

2, 4, 6, 8, …?The 103rd term of this number pattern is …?

Let us consider how we can easily find any term of a number pattern.

When the nth term of a number pattern is written as an algebraic expression in n, it is called the general term of the number pattern.Using the general term, the value of any term in the number pattern can be found.

²The general term of the number pattern of the multiples of a number

h Let us consider the number pattern of the multiples of 2, starting from 2 and written in ascending order.

This number pattern is 2, 4, 6, 8, …

Although the terms from the fifth term onwards are not written, we know that the fifth term is 10, the sixth term is 12 and the seventh term is 14.

Let us find the nth term of this number pattern.The table given below, shows how the value of each term is obtained.

According to the 3rd column of the table, the nth term of the above number pattern is 2 × n ; that is 2n.

The nth term of this number pattern is 2n. This is called the general term of this number pattern. By substituting suitable values for n in 2n, we can obtain the values of the relevant terms.

The value of n in the general term of a number pattern should always be a positive integer. The above number pattern is the same as the even numbers starting from 2 and written in ascending order.

² The general term of the number pattern of the even numbers starting from 2 and written in ascending order is 2n. ² The general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 2 starting from 2 and written in ascending order is 2n.

The general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 and written in ascending order is 3n.

Accordingly,

²the general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 4 starting from 4 and written in ascending order is 4n.

²the general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 7 starting from 7 and written in ascending order is 7n.

Example 2

The general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 and written in ascending order is 3n.(i) Find the 13th term of this number pattern.(ii) Find which term is 87 of this number pattern.

(i) The general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 and written in increasing order is 3n The 13th term of this number pattern = 3 × 13 = 39

(ii) 3n = 87 Let us find the value of n that satisfies this equation. 3n3 = 873 n = 29

∴ 87 is the 29th term of this number pattern.

Example 3

In the number pattern of the multiples of 4 starting from 4 and written in ascending order, with general term 4n,(i) what is the 10th term? (ii) what is the 11th term?(iii) which term is 100?(iv) is 43 a term of this number pattern? What are the reasons for your answer?

(i) The general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 4 = 4n 10th term = 4 × 10 = 40 (ii) The general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 4 = 4n 11th term = 4 × 11 = 44

(iii) Since the general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 4 is 4n,

4n = 100

4n4 = 1004 n = 25 ∴ 100 is the 25th term.

(iv) When 4n = 43

4n4 = 434

n = 10 34 (This is not a positive integer) ∴ 43 cannot be a term of this number pattern.

(8) It has been estimated that in a country having a population of 2 million people, the population will increase by 2 million people every 25 years. Estimate the population of the country in 200 years.

²The general term of the pattern of the odd numbers

You have learnt earlier that odd numbers are numbers which have a remainder of 1when divided by 2.

1, 3, 5, 7, ... is the pattern of the odd numbers starting from 1 written in ascending order.

Since we obtain a remainder of 1 when an odd number is divided by 2, we should obtain an odd number when 1 is subtracted from any multiple of 2.

Accordingly, let us identify how the pattern of the odd numbers is developed by considering the following table.

TermMultiples of 2Multiples of 2 - 1Odd numberFirst term Second termThird term ' 'Tenth term ' ' 'nth term ' ' '

2 = 2 × 14 = 2 × 26 = 2 × 3 ' ' '20 = 2 × 10 ' ' '2n = 2 × n ' ' '

2 - 1 = 1 4 - 1 = 3 6 - 1 = 5 ' ' '20 - 1 = 19 ' ' '2n - 1 ' ' '

The general term of the pattern of the odd numbers starting from 1 and written in ascending order can be expressed in terms of the general term of the pattern of even numbers starting from 2, written in ascending order.

The general term of the pattern of the odd numbers starting from 1 and written in ascending order is 2n – 1.

Example 4

In the pattern of the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, … starting from 1, (i) what is the general term? (ii) what is the 72nd term? (iii) which term is 51?

(i) Since this is the pattern of the odd numbers starting from 1, the general term is 2n – 1.(ii) When n = 72, the seventy second term = 2 × 72 - 1 = 144 - 1 = 143

(iii) Let us take that 51 is the nth term of this number pattern. Then, 2n - 1 = 51 2n - 1 + 1 = 51 + 1 2n = 52

2n2 = 522 n = 26 51 is the 26th term of this number pattern.

Rectangular shaped arrangements of dots that have twice the number of dots as each corresponding figure in the triangular number pattern can be obtained by joining together two equal triangles of the triangular number pattern.

Number of rows 1 2 3 4 Number of columns 2 3 4 5 Total number of dots 1 × 2 2 × 3 3 × 4 4 × 5

Triangular number 1 × 22 = 1 2 × 32 = 3 3 × 42 = 6 4 × 52 = 10

Therefore, the pattern of triangular numbers is as follows. First term = 1 × 22 = 1

Second term = 2 × 32 = 3

Third term = 3 × 42 = 6

Fourth term = 4 × 52 = 10' ' ' ' ' '' ' ' Tenth term = 10 × 112 = 55' ' ' ' ' '' ' ' nth term = n × ^n + 1&2 = n ^n + 1&2

The pattern of the even numbers between 1 and 9 written in ascending order is 2, 4, 6, 8.

If these four numbers are written in descending order as 8, 6, 4, 2, we obtain a different number pattern. A is the set of even numbers between 1 and 9.

We can write the set of even numbers between 1 and 9 as follows.A = {2, 4, 6, 8} = {6, 4, 8, 2} = {8, 6, 4, 2}

Whatever order the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 are written within brackets, we obtain the same set. Elements of a set are not named as the first element, the second element, etc.

∴ Although {2, 4, 6, 8} and {8, 6, 4, 2} are the same set, the number pattern 2, 4, 6, 8 is not equal to the number pattern 8, 6, 4, 2.

Summary

The expression in n obtained for the nth term of a number pattern is called its general term. The value of n in the general term of a number pattern should always be a positive integer.

The general term of the number pattern of the even numbers starting from 2 and written in ascending order is 2n.

The general term of the number pattern of the odd numbers starting from 1 and written in ascending order is 2n - 1.

The general term of the pattern of the square numbers starting from 1 and written in ascending order is n2.

The general term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written

in ascending order is n ^n + 1&2 .

By studying this lesson you will be able to,

²calculate the perimeters of composite rectilinear plane figures composed of two similar or different types of plane figures from equilateral triangles, isosceles triangles, squares and rectangles, and ²solve problems involving the perimeters of composite rectilinear plane figures.

2'1 Perimeter

Suppose we need to find the length around a rectangular plot of land. For this we need to obtain the sum of the lengths of all four sides of the plot.

The measurement that is thus obtained is said to be the perimeter of the plot of land.

You have learnt earlier that, the sum of the lengths of all the sides of a closed rectilinear plane figure is called its perimeter.

Now let us recall some of the formulae you learnt in Grades 6 and 7 that can be used to find the perimeter of certain plane figures.

Two pairs of angles are shown in the figure given below. Let us consider the sum of the magnitudes of each pair of angles.

AC

Q

40o

50o

Z

Y

X

O

ABC + PQR = 40o + 50o

= 90o

XOY + YOZ = 90o

The sum of the magnitudes of the two angles of each pair is obtained as 90˚.

If the sum of a pair of acute angles is 90˚, then that pair of angles is called a pair of complementary angles.

According to this explanation, in the figure given above,

the angles ABC and PQR are a pair of complementary angles, and

the angles XOY and YOZ are a pair of complementary angles.

The acute angle which needs to be added to a given acute angle for the sum of the two angles to be 90o is called the complement of the given angle.

30o + 60o = 90o. Hence, the complement of 30˚ is 60˚.

Example 1

Calculate the complement of 38˚.

ª

Since 90o - 38o = 52o , the complement of 38˚ is 52˚.

ª

48o + 42o = 90o . ∴ ABC and KLM are a pair of complementary angles. 66o + 24o = 90o. ∴ PQR and XYZ are a pair of complementary angles.

²Supplementary angles

Let us consider the sum of the two angles given in the figure.

50oLM

K

130o

Z

YX

KLM + XYZ = 50o + 130o

= 180o

If the sum of a pair of angles is 180˚, then that pair of angles is called a pair of supplementary angles.

According to this explanation, KLM and XYZ are a pair of supplementary angles.

The angle which needs to be added to a given angle of less than 180˚ for the sum to be 180o is called the supplement of the given angle.

60o + 120o = 180o

∴ The supplement of 60o is 120o'

The sum of the two adjacent angles XOZ and ZOY , where OZ is the common arm, and OX and OY are the other arms, can be shown to be 180˚ by measuring the two angles separately.

This establishes the fact that a pair of adjacent angles, located on a straight line in this manner is a pair of supplementary angles.

Summary

If the sum of a pair of acute angles is 90˚, then that pair of angles is called a pair of complementary angles.

The acute angle which needs to be added to a given acute angle for the sum of the two angles to be 90o is called the complement of the given angle.

If the sum of a pair of angles is 180˚, then that pair of angles is called a pair of supplementary angles.

The angle which needs to be added to a given angle of less than 180˚ for the sum to be 180o is called the supplement of the given angle.

A pair of angles which have a common arm and a common vertex and are located on either side of the common arm is called a pair of adjacent angles.

The sum of the angles located around a point on one side of a straight line is 180˚.

The sum of the angles located around a point on a plane is 360˚.

Vertically opposite angles created by the intersection of two straight lines are equal to each other.

4 Directed Numbers

By studying this lesson you will be able to, ²subtract a directed number from another directed number, and ²multiply directed numbers and divide a directed number by a directed number.

4'1 Directed numbers

Let us recall what you learnt in Grade 7 about directed numbers.

Consider the following number line on which the points P and Q are marked.

- 3 - 2 - 1 0 1 2 3 4

QP

²On this number line, the point P represents the directed number ^+3& and the point Q represents the directed number ^-2&'

²^+3& is most often written as 3.

²^-2& and ^+3&" are located on the number line in opposite directions to each other from zero.

²+ ^positive& sign is used to denote the direction in which the directed number ^+3& is located with respect to zero on the number line.

²- ^negative& sign is used to denote the opposite direction, in which the directed number ^-2& is located.

The magnitude of a number represented by a point on the number line is the distance on the number line from zero to that point.

Furthermore, a number gets its sign as + or - according to the position of that number, whether it is to the right or to the left of the point which represents 0.

² Since the distance from zero to point P is 3 units, the magnitude of the directed number (+3) is 3. The magnitude of the directed number ^-2& is 2.

In a directed number, the numerical value shows its magnitude and the + or – sign its direction.

^+3&" ^-7&" ^+2'5&" ^-3'4&" ^+ 3 12

Note

• It is important to note that, while using the symbol + or - to denote the direction of a number, the symbol + is also used to denote the addition of two directed numbers and the symbol - is used to denote subtraction of a directed number from another directed number.

• We have to understand that the symbols + and - are used in two different senses here.

• To differentiate this clearly, we write directed numbers within brackets.

²Adding directed numbers

Since the sign of a directed number is important, we should pay special attention to the sign when performing mathematical operations.

You learnt in Grade 7 how the addition of directed numbers can be explained easily by using the number line.

The addition of directed numbers can be explained easily by using the number line in the following manner too.

h Let us find the value of (+2) + (+3) by using the number line.

- 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

² Mark the directed number (+2) on the number line.

- 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

² From this point, move 3 units, which is the magnitude of (+3), to the right, which is the direction of (+3) along the number line.

² The directed number (+5) represented by the ending point is the sum of the above two directed numbers.

That is, the directed number which is obtained when you move 3 units to the right along the number line from (+2) is (+5).

- 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6∴ ^+2& + ^+3& = ^+5&

The steps we followed are given below in order.

When adding a directed number to another directed number do the following.

$ Mark the point which represents the first directed number on the number line.

$ From that point, move a distance equal to the magnitude of the second directed number towards the direction of the second directed number. $ The directed number which is represented by the ending point is the answer.

Example 1

Find the value of ^-3& + ^-2& by using the number line.

- 6 - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 1

From ^-3&" when you move two units to the left, which is the direction of ^-2&" the directed number you end at is ^-5&'

∴ ^-3& + ^-2& = ^-5&

²Adding directed numbers without using the number line

What you learnt in Grade 7 about the addition of directed numbers without using the number line is presented here.

Let us find the value without using the number line.

When adding two directed numbers of the same sign, first add the two numbers without considering their signs. Include the same sign in the answer.

(i) ^+3& + ^+2& = ^+5& (ii) ^-4& + ^-6& = ^-10&

When adding two directed numbers of different signs (positive and negative), first find the difference of their numerical values, without considering their signs. Include the sign of the directed number having the larger magnitude in the answer.

(iii) Let us find the value of ^+8& + ^-3&' (iv) Let us find the value of ^+4'2& + ^-6'3&' 8 - 3 = 5 6'3 - 4'2 = 2'1 ∴ ^+8& + ^-3& = ^+5& ∴ ^+4'2& + ^-6'3& = ^-2'1&Do the following review exercise to recall what you learnt in Grade 7 about directed numbers.

4'2 Subtracting a directed number from another directed number

Now let us consider how to subtract a directed number from another directed number by using the number line. Let us first find out what is meant by the direction opposite to that of a given directed number.

² The magnitude of (+3) is 3 and its direction is towards the right.The direction opposite to that of (+3) is towards the left.

² The magnitude of (-3) is 3 and its direction is towards the left. The direction opposite to that of (-3) is towards the right.

h Let us find the value of (+2) - (+3) by using the number line.

- 2 - 1 0 +1 +2 +3

² First mark the directed number (+2) on the number line.

- 2 - 1 0 +1 +2 +3

² From this point, move 3 units which is the magnitude of (+3), towards the left, which is the direction opposite to that of (+3).

² The answer is the directed number represented by the ending point.

The answer is obtained from the point which is 3 units to the left of (+2)'∴ ^+2& - ^+3& = ^-1&

²More on subtracting a directed number from a directed number

By solving the equation a + 1 = 0" let us find the value of a which satisfies this equation.

The value of a cannot be 0 or a positive whole number.

Let us subtract 1 from both sides of the equation a + 1 = 0'a + 1 - 1 = 0 - 1 a = - 1

By taking the value of a in this equation to be ^-1&"

we obtain the relationship ^-1& + 1 = 0'

This can also be written as 1 + ^-1& = 0'

^-1& is called the additive inverse of ^+1&'

Furthermore, the additive inverse of ^-1& is ^+1&'

• Likewise, every positive number has a corresponding additive inverse which is a negative number of equal magnitude.• Similarly, every negative number has an additive inverse which is a positive number of equal magnitude.

Now let us consider subtracting a directed number from another directed number without using the number line.5 - 2 = 3'

Let us consider subtracting 2 from 5 by 5 and 2 as directed numbers.

Let us write the additive inverse of 2 as a directed number and add it to 5.

The additive inverse of ^+ 2& is ^-2&'^+5& + ^-2& = 3

Subtracting a number from another number is the same as adding the additive inverse of the second number to the first number.

5'1 Algebraic expressions

Let us recall what you learnt in Grade 7 about algebraic expressions.

A certain shop purchases the same amount of milk every day to sell. If we don’t know the exact amount, we cannot represent it by a number, although the amount is a constant value.

As in the above situation, when the numerical value of a constant amount is not known, it is called an unknown constant.

The daily income of Nimal's shop takes different values depending on its daily sales.

Since the daily income of Nimal’s shop is not a fixed value, it is a variable.

Simple letters of the English alphabet are used to represent unknown constants and variables.

Let us denote the daily income from Nimal's shop by x. Nimal gives Rs.500 to his mother daily from the income from his shop. After giving Rs.500 to his mother, Nimal has an amount of Rs. x – 500 remaining.

x − 500 is an algebraic expression. x and 500 are the terms of the expression.

If 350 rambutans are sold at Rs. x each, the income is Rs. 350x. In the algebraic term 350x, 350 is called the coefficient of x.

Method II

The mass of the 5 containers with balls = 5x The mass of the 5 empty containers = 5y The mass of the balls in the 5 containers = 5x - 5y

It is clear that 5(x - y) = 5x - 5y

∴ 5(x - y) = 5x - 5y

A rectangular land is divided into two blocks A and B as shown in the figure. Both blocks are rectangular in shape and equal in breadth. Let us find the area of the whole land.

Method I

Area of block A = a × x = ax Area of block B = a × y = ay

So the area of the whole land = ax + ay

We can obtain the area of the land in the following manner too.

Method II

The length of the whole land = (x + y) The breadth of the land = a ∴ the area of the land = a (x + y)

Now it is clear that a (x + y) = ax + ay

∴ a (x + y) = ax + ay

When multiplying an algebraic expression by an algebraic term, every algebraic term of the algebraic expression is multiplied by the given algebraic term.

²Like terms

In Grade 7 you learnt that algebraic terms such as x and 2x with the same unknown are called like terms.

In each of the two terms 3xy and 5xy, the coefficient is multiplied by the common term xy which is the product of the two unknowns x and y. Therefore, they are also known as like terms.

²Unlike terms

You learnt in Grade 7 that terms such as 2x and 4y which have different unknowns are called unlike terms.

Let us consider the algebraic terms 3x2y and 5xy2.

The coefficient of 3x2y is 3 and the product of the unknowns by which it is multiplied is x2y.

The coefficient of 5xy2 is 5 and the product of the unknowns by which it is multiplied is xy2.

In these two terms, the products of the unknowns are not the same.

Such algebraic terms are not like terms. Therefore they are known as unlike terms.Like terms can be added or subtracted and simplified to a single algebraic term.

Euler's relationship In a solid with straight edges, the sum of the number of faces and the number of vertices is two more than the number of edges.

This relationship can be expressed as follows.

Number of Vertices + Number of Faces = Number of Edges + 2 V + F = E + 2

²find the highest common factor of the terms of a set which consists of up to three algebraic terms, ²write an algebraic expression as a product of two factors, where one factor is the highest common factor of the terms of the algebraic expression, and ²establish that an algebraic expression written in terms of its factors is the given algebraic expression, by multiplying the factors.

7'1 The highest common factor (HCF) of several numbers

6 = 2 × 3

You have learnt previously that 2 and 3 are factors of 6.

When a number is written as a product of two whole numbers, those numbers are called factors of the original number.

The HCF of two or more numbers is the largest of all the common factors of the given numbers. That is, the largest number by which all the given numbers are divisible is their HCF.

Now let us find the HCF of 6 and 10. 6 = 1 × 6 10 = 1 × 10 6 = 2 × 3 10 = 2 × 5

∴ the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6.The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 and 10.

1 and 2 are the common factors of 6 and 10. Since 2 is the larger factor, the HCF of 6 and 10 is 2.

7'2 The highest common factor of several algebraic terms

Now let us see what is meant by the HCF of several algebraic terms and how to find it.

Let us find the HCF of the algebraic terms 4x, 8xy and 6xyz.

Let us write each term as a product of its factors.

Here, the coefficient of each algebraic term is written as a product of its prime factors and the unknowns are separated and written as a product.

4x = 2 × 2 × x 8xy = 2 × 2 × 2 × x × y6xyz = 2 × 3 × x × y × z

The common factors of all three algebraic terms, 4x, 8xy and 6xyz are 2 and x. The HCF of the algebraic terms, 4x, 8xy and 6xyz is the product of the factors which are common to all three terms.

∴ The HCF of 4x" 8xy and 6xyz = 2 × x = 2x

Since 2 and 3 are the prime factors of 6, 6 can be written as a product of its prime factors as 6 = 2 × 3'

Now let us consider how to write an algebraic expression as a product of its factors.

Let us find the perimeter of the rectangle in the figure.

Method I

xo

64

Method II

Let us find the perimeter by multiplying the sum of the length and breadth of the rectangle by two.

Perimeter of the rectangle = (x + y) × 2 = 2(x + y) Since the perimeter of the same rectangle is found by both methods, the two expressions obtained for the perimeter are equal.

∴ 2x + 2y = 2(x + y)

Writing the algebraic expression 2x + 2y as 2(x + y), is called writing the algebraic expression 2x + 2y as a product of factors.

That is, 2 and (x + y) are two factors of the expression 2x + 2y.

¾Now let us write the algebraic expression 12x + 18y as a product of two factors.

12x + 18y can be expressed as a product of two factors in several ways.

(i) 12x + 18y = 2 × 6x + 2 × 9y = 2(6x + 9y) In this instance, 2 is taken as a common factor of the two terms.

(ii) 12x + 18y = 3 × 4x + 3 × 6y = 3(4x + 6y)In this instance, 3 is taken as a common factor of the two terms.

(iii) 12x + 18y = 6 × 2x + 6 × 3y = 6(2x + 3y) In this instance, 6 is taken as a common factor of the two terms.

Since there is no common factor in 2x and 3y, which are the terms of the expression within brackets, 6 is the HCF of the terms 12x and 18y.

When writing such an algebraic expression as a product of factors, the convention is to write the first factor as a number which is the HCF of the terms of the given expression, and the other factor as an algebraic expression, where the HCF of its terms is 1.

Accordingly, when writing an algebraic expression as a product of factors,

$ first find the highest common factor of the terms of the algebraic expression,

$ take this HCF as one factor and the expression which is obtained by dividing each term of the algebraic expression by this HCF as the other factor, and $ write the algebraic expression as a product of these two factors.

7'4 Writing an algebraic expression as a product of factors where one factor is a negative number

Since (-12) = (-6) × 2, we have that (-6) is a factor of (-12).

Since (-12) = 6 × (-2), (-2) is also a factor of (-12).

Since 12 = (- 6) × (-2) , both (-6) and (-2) are factors of 12.

Example 1

(i) Write (-15) as a product of two factors, such that (-3) is a factor. (-15) = (-3) × 5

(ii) Write 10 as a product of two factors such that (-2) is a factor. 10 = (-2) × (-5) Accordingly, (-2) and (-5) are two factors of 10.

Now let us consider an instance where one factor of the algebraic expression is a negative number. Let us consider the algebraic expression -2x + 6y. Here, 2 is a common factor of -2x and 6y. Therefore, - 2x + 6y = 2 ^-- x + 3y&

Since -- 2x -= ^- 2& × x and 6y = ^- 2& × ^- 3& × y,(-2) is also a common factor of - 2x and 6y.∴- - 2x -+ 6y -= ^- 2& × x + ^- 2& × ^- 3& y = ^- 2& ^x + ^- 3& y& = - 2 ^x - 3y&∴- -the algebraic expression - 2x -+ 6y can also be written as a product of two factors as - 2 ^x - 3y&'

7'5 More on writing an algebraic expression as a product of two factors

Let us consider the algebraic expression pq + pr.pq = p × q

pr = p × r

Since p is a factor of each term of this expression, p is a common factor of the two terms.

∴ pq + pr = p × q + p × r

= p^-q + r&

Accordingly, when writing an algebraic expression as a product of factors,

$ first find the HCF of the terms of the algebraic expression,

$ take the HCF as one factor and the expression which is obtained by dividing each term of the algebraic expression by the HCF as the other factor, and $ write the algebraic expression as a product of these two factors.

Example 1

Write the expression 18x + 24xy + 12xz as a product of two factors.

The HCF of the terms 18x, 24xy and 12xz is 6x

∴ 18x + 24xy + 12xz = 6x × 3 + 6x × 4y + 6x × 2z = 6x ^-3 + 4y + 2z&

When the HCF 3a is separated out as a common factor and written we obtain,

3a + 6ab + 12ac = 3a (1 + 2b + 4c).Note that when the expression within brackets is multiplied by 3a, the original expression, 3a + 6ab + 12ac is obtained.

3a (1 + 2b + 4c) = 3a + 6ab + 12ac∴ 3a + 6ab + 12ac is the product of the two factors 3a and (1 + 2b + 4c).

8'3 The square root of a perfect square

16 = 4 × 4 = 42' Since16 is the square of 4, the square root of 16 is 4.

49 = 72, so the square root of 49 is 7.

81 = 92" so the square root of 81 is 9.

To indicate the square root of a number, we use the symbol —˜ .

Accordingly; the square root of 16 = 16 = 42 = 4"the square root of 25 = 25 = 52 = 5" the square root of 100 = 100 = 102 = 10" the square root of 4 = 4 = 2 ^because 22 = 4& the square root of 1 = 1 = 1 ^ because 12 = 1&

If c = a2 where a is a positive number, then c = a. That is, a is the square root of c.

If a number is the square of a positive number, then the second number is the square root of the first.

The square roots of perfect squares such as 36, 49, 64 can be expressed quickly from memory. However it is not easy to do the same for every perfect square.

We have to use different methods to find them.Let us see how we can find the square root,

Since 40 × 40 = 1600" the square root of a number between 101 and 1000 will be less than 40. Therefore, the square root of such a number will only have digits in the units place and the tens place.

The digit in the tens place of the square root of a perfect square is as follows.

²If the digit in the hundreds place of a number is a perfect square, then the square root of that digit is the digit in the tens place of the answer (the square root of the perfect square).

²If the digit in the hundreds place of a number is not a perfect square, then the square root of the perfect square which is closest and less than the digit in the hundreds place, is the digit in the tens place of the answer.

Example 1

Find 961.• Since the digit in the units place is 1, the digit in the units place of the square root must be 1 or 9. • The digit in the hundreds place of the given number is 9, so the digit in the tens place of the square root is 9 , which is 3.

By studying this lesson, you will be able to, ²identify metric ton as a unit used to measure mass, ²know the relationship between kilogramme and metric ton. ²solve problems associated with mass which include metric tons.

9'1 Units used to measure mass

You have learnt before that milligramme, gramme and kilogramme are units used to measure mass. Now let us identify another unit used to measure mass.

It is mentioned that the mass of the paracetamol in a paracetamol tablet shown in the figure is 500 mg.

250 g

New

It is mentioned that the mass of the margarine in the packet of margarine shown in the figure is 250 g.

It is mentioned that the mass of the cement in the bag of cement shown in the figure is 50 kg.

The approximate mass of the lorry loaded with goods shown in the figure is mentioned as 20 t.

According to the information given above, in order to measure a heavy mass like a lorry, the unit metric ton is used, which is larger than the unit kilogramme (kg). The letter t is used to indicate “metric ton”.

One metric ton is equal to a thousand kilogrammes. Accordingly, 1 t = 1000 kg

The relationship between the above mentioned units used to measure mass is given below.

1 g = 1000 mg 1 kg = 1000 g 1 t = 1000 kg

9'2 The relationship between kilogramme and metric ton

²Expressing a mass given in metric tons in kilogrammes

Now let us see how to express a mass given in metric tons in kilogrammes. Since 1 t = 1000 kg 2 t = 2 × 1000 kg = 2000 kg3 t = 3 × 1000 kg = 3000 kg

Accordingly, in order to express a mass given in metric tons in kilogrammes, the amount given in metric tons should be multiplied by 1000.

Example 1

Express 8.756 t in kilogrammes.8'756 t = 8'756 × 1000 kg = 8756 kg

Example 2

Express 3 t 850 kg in kilogrammes.3 t 850 kg = 3 t + 850 kg = 3 × 1000 kg + 850 kg = 3000 kg + 850 kg = 3850 kg

Example 3Example 4

Express 8.756 t in metric tons and kilogrammes. 8'756 t = 8 t + 0'756 t = 8 t + 0'756 × 1000 kg = 8 t + 756 kg = 8 t 756 kg

Express 13 2 t in kilogrammes. 13 2 t = 3 t + 1 2 t

= 3 × 1000 kg + 500 kg

= 3000 kg + 500 kg

= 3500 kg

²Expressing a mass given in kilogrammes in metric tons

Next let us see how to express a mass given in kilogrammes in metric tons.

Since 1000 kg = 1 t

2000 kg = 10002000 t = 2 t

3000 kg = 10003000 t = 3 t

Accordingly, in order to express a mass given in kilogrammes in metric tons, the amount given in kilogrammes should be divided by 1000.

When expressing a mass of 1000 kg or more in kilogrammes and metric tons, the number of kilogrammes is written as an addition of a multiple of 1000 and a number less than 1000.

Example 5

Express 2758 kg in metric tons.

2758 kg = 27581000 t

10 Indices

By studying this lesson you will be able to,

²express a power of a product as a product of powers,

²express a product of powers as a power of a product, and

²find the value of a power of a negative integer by expansion.

10'1 Indices

Let us recall what was learnt in Grade 7 about indices.

You learnt in Grade 7 that 23 and x4 are respectively a power of 2 and a power of x. In 23, the base is 2 and the index is 3.

These can be expanded and written as products as 23 = 2 × 2 × 2 and x4 = x × x × x × x.

Accordingly, 3x2 y3 = 3 × x × x × y × y × y and 3ab = 3 × a × b'Since 6 = 2 × 3" we say that 6 is the product of 2 and 3.Similarly, since 3ab = 3 × a × b, we say that 3ab is the product of 3, a and b.

Do the following review exercise to recall the facts that have been learnt so far regarding indices.

10'2 Expressing a power of a product as a product of powers

2 × 3 is the product of 2 and 3. ^2 × 3&2 is a power of the product 2 × 3'

Let us write ^2 × 3&2 as a product of powers of 2 and 3.

^2 × 3&2 = ^2 × 3& × ^2 × 3& = 2 × 3 × 2 × 3 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 22 × 32

∴ ^2 × 3&2 = 22 × 32 Now let us write ^2 × 3&3 as a product of powers of 2 and 3.

^2 × 3&3 = ^2 × 3& × ^2 × 3& × ^2 × 3& = 2 × 3 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 3 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 23 × 33

∴ ^2 × 3&3 = 23 × 33

Accordingly, the power of a product can be written in this manner as a product of powers of the factors of the given product.

Now let us consider a power of a product that contains unknown terms. ^ab&3 = ab × ab × ab = a × b × a × b × a × b = a × a × a × b × b × b = a3 × b3 = a3 b3

^ab&3 = a3b3

11 Symmetry

By studying this lesson you will be able to, ²identify the rotational symmetry of a plane figure, ²find the order of rotational symmetry of a plane figure that has rotational symmetry, and ²find the relationship between the number of axes of bilateral symmetry and the order of rotational symmetry of a plane figure which is bilaterally symmetrical.

11'1 Bilateral symmetry

You learnt in Grade 7 that if it is possible to fold a plane figure through a line on it to get two identical parts which coincide with each other, then it is called a bilaterally symmetrical plane figure. You also learnt that such a line of a bilaterally symmetrical figure is known as an axis of symmetry of the figure.

The two parts on either side of an axis of symmetry of a bilaterally symmetrical figure are equal in shape and area.

If by folding a plane figure along a line, it is divided into two parts which are equal in area and shape, but the two parts do not coincide with each other, then that line is not an axis of symmetry of the plane figure.

11'2 Rotational symmetry

When a plane figure is rotated about a point on it through one complete rotation in the plane of the figure, it coincides with the original position at least once.

There are some figures, which when rotated about a point on it through one complete rotation, coincide several times with the original position.

The number of times a figure coincides with the original position varies, depending on the point about which it is rotated.

Do the following activity to establish this property further.

Activity 1

A

X

Z

Y

B

CD

Step 1 - Draw a square ABCD and mark the points X, Y and Z as in the given figure.

Step 2 - Trace the figure ABCD onto a transparent sheet like an oil paper or a plastic paper and mark the points X, Y and Z on it.

Step 3 - Overlap the two figures so that they coincide, and keep them in place with a pin fixed at point X.

Step 4 - Rotate the figure on the transparent sheet about the pin point (point X) and observe whether the two figures coincide with each other. Find the number of times the two figures coincide with each other when the transparent sheet is rotated once about X.

Step 5 - As above, rotate the figure on the transparent sheet once about the points Y and Z too, and find the number of times the two figures coincide with each other.

Step 6 - Draw the following table in your exercise book and complete it.

PointXYZNumber of times the figures coincide

While doing the above activity you would have observed that when the figure on the transparent sheet was rotated once about the points X and Z, the two figures coincided with each other only once at the completion of one rotation, and that when the figure was rotated about the point Y, it coincided four times with the original figure during one complete rotation.

When a plane figure is rotated about a fixed point in it through one complete rotation (i.e., 360o), if it coincides with the original position before completing one rotation, then it is said to have rotational symmetry. The point about which the figure is rotated is called the centre of rotation.

When a plane figure that has rotational symmetry is rotated once about a point which is not the centre of rotation, then it coincides with the original figure only when it completes one complete rotation.

The number of times a figure that has rotational symmetry coincides with itself when it is rotated once about the centre of rotation is called its order of rotational symmetry.

From the above activity, it is clear that a square has rotational symmetry, that its centre of rotation is the point at which its axes of symmetry intersect, and that its order of rotational symmetry is 4.

Activity 2

Step 1 - Draw a rectangle in your exercise book and name it ABCD.

Step 2 - Copy the rectangle ABCD onto a plastic paper and place it on the original figure so that they coincide with each other. By using a pin, rotate the plastic paper about O as in activity 1 and find out whether the rectangle has rotational symmetry. If it does, find its order of rotational symmetry.

• The center of rotational symmetry of a bilaterally symmetrical plane figure which has rotational symmetry, is the point of intersection of its axes of bilateral symmetry.• If the order of rotational symmetry of a plane figure is 2 or more, then that figure is said to have rotational symmetry.

(iv) The point of intersection of the axes of symmetry of a bilaterally symmetrical plane figure which has more than one axis of symmetry is its centre of rotational symmetry.

(v) A scalene triangle does not have rotational symmetry and is also not bilaterally symmetrical.

Summary

When a plane figure is rotated about a special point in it through an angle of 360o, if it coincides with the original position before completing a full rotation, then it is said to have rotational symmetry. The center of rotational symmetry of a bilaterally symmetrical plane figure which has rotational symmetry, is the point of intersection of its axes of bilateral symmetry. The order of rotational symmetry of a figure that has rotational symmetry is greater than 1.

When a plane figure is rotated about its centre of rotation, the number of times it coincides with the original position during a complete rotation is called its order of rotational symmetry.

¾ Draw another triangle in your exercise book, produce the sides to form exterior angles at the three vertices, and by measuring them, obtain the sum of the exterior angles of the triangle.

It is clear from the above activity, that the three exterior angles of a triangle can be positioned as three angles around a point.

Since the sum of the angles around a point is 360˚, the sum of the exterior angles of a triangle is also 360˚.

This result is obtained by measuring the angles as well. According to the given figure,

^a + p& + ^b + q& + ^c + r& = 180o + 180o + 180o

The exterior angles created by producing the sides of the quadrilateral ABCD are marked in the figure as a, b, c and d .

A quadrilateral has four vertices. Hence, there are four exterior angles.

Although there are two exterior angles formed at every vertex of a quadrilateral, they are equal in magnitude since they are vertically opposite angles.

When one exterior angle at each vertex is considered, then the sum of these angles is said to be the sum of the exterior angles of the quadrilateral.

Let us engage in the activity given below in order to find the sum of the exterior angles of a quadrilateral.

It is clear from the above activity that the sum of the exterior angles of a quadrilateral is 360˚.

The sum of the exterior angles of a quadrilateral is 360˚.

According to the given figure,

a + p + b + q + c + r + d + s = 180o + 180o + 180o + 180o

^a + b + c + d & + ^p + q + r + s & = 720o

Since a + b + c + d = 360o,360o + p + q + r + s = 720o

13 Fractions I

By studying this lesson, you will be able to,• multiply a fraction by a whole number,• multiply a fraction by a fraction,• multiply a fraction by a mixed number, and• multiply a mixed number by a mixed number.

13.1 Fractions

Let us first recall what you have learnt about fractions in Grades 6 and 7. Let us take the area of the figure given below as a unit.

This unit has been divided into five equal parts of which three parts are coloured. You have learnt that the coloured area is 35 of the whole area.

You have also learnt that if a unit is divided into equal parts, then one part or several of these parts is called a fraction of the unit. A portion of a collection is also considered as a fraction of that collection.

In addition, you have learnt that fractions such as 35" 12 and 23 which are less than one and greater than zero are called proper fractions.

A number which has been written by adding together a whole number and a proper fraction is called a mixed number or an improper fraction, depending on how it has been represented.

Some examples of mixed numbers are 112 " 213 and 425 .

In the mixed number 425 , the whole part is 4 and the fractional part is 25 .

Some examples of improper fractions are 32 , 53 and 117 .

The numerator of an improper fraction is greater than or equal to the denominator.

A fraction equivalent to a given fraction can be obtained by multiplying the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by the same non-zero number.

A fraction equivalent to a given fraction can also be obtained by dividing the numerator and the denominator by a non - zero common factor of the numerator and the denominator.

²Representing a mixed number as an improper fraction

By following the steps given below, a mixed number can be represented as an improper fraction.

$ Multiply the whole number part of the mixed number by the denominator of the fractional part, and add it to the numerator of the fractional part.

$ The denominator of the improper fraction is the same as the denominator of the fractional part of the mixed number.

²Representing an improper fraction as a mixed number

You learnt in Grade 7 how to represent an improper fraction as a mixed number.

Let us represent 74 as a mixed number.

74 = 7 ÷ 4 14 7 4 3The quotient and remainder of 7 ÷ 4 are 1 and 3 respectively. The quotient is the whole number part of the mixed number and the remainder is the numerator of the fractional part.The denominator of the fractional part of the mixed number is the same as the denominator of the improper fraction.

∴ 74 34= 1

15

Let us consider how much the total of these three parts is from the entire cake. For this, we have to add these three quantities.

It is 15

+ 15

+ 15 = 35

You have learnt previously that addition of the same number repeatedly can be represented as a multiplication.

For example, 2 + 2 + 2 = 2 × 3 = 6

Accordingly, we can write 15

+ 15

+ 15 = 15 × 3

Therefore, 15 × 3 = 35 . That is, three 15

is equal to 35 '

² The figure depicts a rectangle which has been divided

into eight equal parts. One part is 18 of the entire figure.

Let us consider the sum of 5 such parts.

It can be written as 18

+ 18

+ 18 + 18 + 18 = 58

That is, five 18 s is equal to 58

1 unit13 unitFurthermore, the area of the rectangular shaped lamina in the

figure which is of length 1 unit and breadth 13 units is 13 square

units.

That is, 1 × 13 = 13

You have learnt in the previous section that 13 × 1 = 13

∴ 13 × 1 = 1 × 13

Similarly,27 × 3 = 67 and 3 × 27 = 67 ∴ 27 × 3 = 3 × 27

∴ 411 × 2 = 2 × 411

∴ 213 × 5 = 5 × 213

411 × 2 = 811 and 2 × 411 = 811

213 × 5 = 1013 and 5 × 213 = 1013

13The figure shows a square shaped lamina of side length 1 unit. It is divided into 6 equal parts, of which one part is shaded as in the figure.

Since the shaded part is 16 of the whole area of the lamina, its area is 16 square units.

Also, the shape of the shaded part is rectangular. Its length is 12 the length of the square lamina and its breadth is 13 the breadth of the square lamina.

23

The figure shows a square shaped lamina of side length 1 unit. It is divided into 15 equal parts.

Let us find the area of the shaded part using two different methods.

Method I

Since the area of the shaded part is 615 of the area of the whole lamina, the area of

this part is 615 square units.

Method II

The length of the shaded part of the rectangular shape = 23 of the length of the

square (that is, 23

units)

Its breadth = 35 of the length of the square (that is, 35 units).

∴ The area of the shaded part is 35 × 23 square units.

∴ 35 × 23 = 615

Let us consider the above two cases.12 × 13 = 16 ^ 1 × 12 × 3 = 16&

35 × 23 = 615 ^ 3 × 25 × 3 = 615&

38 × 45 = 1240

In the fraction 1240, since 4 is a common factor of both the numerator and the denominator, let us divide the numerator as well as the denominator by 4.

1240 = 12 ÷ 4 40 ÷ 4 = 310

14'2 Dividing a fraction by a whole number

The picture shows a whole cake and 12 a cake.

Suppose we want to share this portion (12 a cake) equally between Kamal and Amal. Let us consider the share that one person gets from the whole cake, when half the cake is divided equally between them.

This share is 12 ÷ 2'

It is clear from the picture that this share is 14 of the whole cake.

Accordingly, 12 ÷ 2 = 14

The figure on the right hand side shows a square shaped card of which 14 has been coloured.

If the coloured portion of this card is divided into two equal parts, let us find what fraction of the whole square each of the two parts is.

It is clear from the figure that each part is 18 of the whole square.

This can also be written as 14 ÷ 2'

∴ 14 ÷ 2 = 18

Consider 14th of the circle shown in the figure. If this is divided further into three equal portions, let us find what fraction of the whole circle each portion is.

It is clear that each portion is 112 th of the whole circle.

∴ 14 ÷ 3 = 112

Now let us consider each of the above cases one by one.

12 ÷ 2 = 14' In addition, 12 × 12 = 14' ∴ 12 ÷ 2 = 12 × 12

14 ÷ 2 = 18' In addition, 14 × 12 = 18' ∴ 14 ÷ 2 = 14 × 12

14 ÷ 3 = 112' In addition, 14 × 13 = 112' ∴ 14 ÷ 3 = 14 × 13

Dividing a fraction by a number is the same as multiplying the fraction by the reciprocal of that number.

²Dividing a whole number by a fraction

Let us now consider how a whole number is divided by a fraction. We can study this through examples.

Example 3

Find the value of 1 ÷ 13 '

Let us consider the rectangular lamina shown here as one unit.

This unit has been divided into three equal parts. One of these

parts is 13'

Accordingly, there are three 13 portions in one unit.

∴ 1 ÷ 13 = 3 When 1 is multiplied by 3, which is the reciprocal of 13, the same answer is obtained.∴ 1 ÷ 13 = 1 × 31 = 3' Example 4

Find the value of 2 ÷ 14 '

Let us explain this by considering two rectangular shaped laminas of the same size. Let us consider each rectangular lamina as one unit.

When a lamina is divided into four equal parts, there are four 14 in one unit.
