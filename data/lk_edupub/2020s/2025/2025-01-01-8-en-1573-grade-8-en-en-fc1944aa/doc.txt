Foreword

With the continuous advancement of the world, the education sector too is transformed. Therefore, if we require the creation of a student community who could confront the future challenges successfully, our learning teaching process must constantly utilize effective approaches. It is our responsibility to disseminate the knowledge of the new world while assisting to create global citizens with good values. Our department is actively engaged in producing learning tools with the great aim of contributing to enlighten the minds of the children of the country.

A textbook is a repository of knowledge. At times, it takes us to a world of entertainment while developing our critical thinking faculties. It promotes our hidden potentials. In the coming years, the memories related to these textbooks will bring you happiness. While making the maximum use of this valuable learning tool, you must essentially access other useful knowledge spaces too. This textbook is offered to you free of charge as a great gift of the free education. Only you can add a value to the great fortune that has been spent by the government to print these textbooks. I wish that you would gain the ability to enlighten the future as citizens with knowledge and values by using this textbook.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the panels of writers, editors and reviewers as well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department for the contribution made on this endeavor.

Activity 1.4

Act outThe Science Society of Saranga’s school has decided to organize a science exhibition. Saranga was invited to share his camp experience with his friends in the Science Society.

Saranga: Hello friends, thank you for inviting me to speak to you this morning. We organized our annual English Camp successfully. So, I’m here to share my experience with all of you. Honestly, organizing a camp is a big task. You must be wondering how I managed to do it. My father is a great planner and his motto in life is, “Plan the work, work the plan”. So we simply followed his motto. We started off by laying out a plan. Then, we thought we should have a discussion. We even planned what we hope to talk there. Each of us carried a small notebook with us which we used to note down all the important information. This book helped us a lot. Whenever, we met to discuss our plans, we would share the notes that we had made. Therefore, everybody knew what is needed to be done. This made the organizing of the work easy for us. In short, planning helped us in organizing the work well. Yes, Ravi do you have any questions?

Ravi: Did you take a lot of time to plan the work?

Saranga: Yes, it took us a whole day to plan the work. But, in the end we didn’t feel that it was a waste of time. The time spent for planning is an investment. You know, planning helps us to ensure good results. Our initial planning helped us to reduce our shortcomings. Last year we didn’t plan our work well and as a result we had to face a number of problems. In a nutshell, the simple thing to do is to plan your work and then, work your plan. Do you have any questions?

Ravi: Thank you Saranga, it’s so nice of you to have come here to share your experience with us.Saranga: My pleasure. All the best!

Dear Svetlana,

Thank you very much for your letter and the lovely photographs. Hope everything is going well at your end. I was a little busy during the last few weeks. We had a lot of work to do at school. I prepared a plan to complete all the school work on time.

I was so happy to know that you are a nature lover as I am. You have asked me about the extra curricular activities that I am involved in. You know, I’m a very active member of the Nature Club of our school. Every month we plan a special programme.

This time we organized a beach clean-up. Many people on the beach including the tourists volunteered to help us to clean the beach. At this event, the Local Environmental Organization conducted an awareness programme to educate the public on the importance of using eco-friendly products. At this programme they spoke about the importance of using eco-friendly paper, cloth bags and paper cups. Some people bought some of the eco-friendly products that were available there. Interestingly, one foreign tourist shared his personal experience on how he was able to change the attitudes of his neighbours on protecting the environment.

By the way Svetlana, your younger sister looks very sweet. When will she start school? Give my regards to your family. I’m sending some family photographs with this letter. Hope to hear from you soon.Love,Amitha

He decided to try again. ‘Come on, my friend, why aren’t you talking to me? You must have a reason. Did anyone ill- treat you, or are you angry with me?’ asked the fox. ‘No’, said the peacock in a low voice. ‘Then, what happened?’ asked the fox. ‘I don’t like my voice. Every time, I open my mouth to sing, I hear an unpleasant sound,’ replied the peacock. ‘But you are one of the most beautiful birds in the animal kingdom. Why should you worry about your voice?’ said the fox. ‘I want to sing as beautifully as a nightingale,’ replied the peacock. ‘Oh, was that the reason why you looked so unhappy? Do you know, just as much as it is impossible for a nightingale to be as beautiful as you are, you too cannot sing as beautifully as a nightingale,’ replied the fox. ‘Remember, my friend, we should not compare ourselves with others. We have to be happy and content with what we have,’ the fox said.Answer the question given below.Find one word for each of the following phrases from the text. a) Feeling sad - b) Unable to be done - c) To make someone feel discomfort - d) To treat badly - e) To make someone lose confidence -

Courtesy

Courtesy means polite behaviour towards others. Such behaviour includes good manners and a respectful attitude towards others. A courteous person is decent in speech and behaviour and is considerate of others. In return, such people are admired and respected by society.

Being courteous does not require hard work or effort. We have only to be aware and respectful of other people’s feelings. Using, expressions like excuse me, thank you, I’m sorry, please and you are welcome, is one way to show our courtesy. What is meant by courtesy can be summed up in the saying “Treat others as you want to be treated.”

The Magic Words Once there was a king who had a strange problem. Even though he was an honest and just king, his people did not follow his orders. No matter how hard he tried to make his people follow his orders, they did not obey him. However, since he was a just king, he did not want to punish his people only for not following his orders. Therefore, the king summoned a great wizard who was known to be the wisest man in the kingdom. He asked the wizard if he could cast a spell that would make the people of this kingdom obey the king’s orders.

The old wizard, who did not want to disappoint the king, cast a spell on the people of the kingdom. But all his efforts were futile. None of the people followed the king’s orders.

One day a young man came to the palace. He said that he possessed powerful magical powers that could solve the king’s problem. The king was overjoyed and gave him permission to start his work immediately.

In a very short time, the young man came to the king with two small parchments and said, “Your Majesty, these are the spells that I have prepared for you. Whenever, you are giving orders to your people, use the words that I have written here. If they smile that means the spell has worked. The most important thing about my spell is that it won’t wear off. It’ll last forever.”

The king was very excited. He saw a servant passing by and said the first word and asked him to bring a platter of food. For a moment, the servant looked bewildered. Within a few minutes, the servant was in front of the king, with a platter of food with a smile on his face. The king was amazed. He uttered the second magic word and said “You may go.” The servant left feeling happy. Before long all the citizens began to obey the king. Not only did they comply with his orders, they complied with them willingly.

Soon the news about the young man who could cast such

powerful spells spread everywhere in the kingdom. Before long the old wizard heard about the young man and came to meet him. “It’s a great honour to meet a wizard as powerful as you,” he said. “Would you mind sharing with me the secret of your magic?” The young man smiled and said, “My friend, I’m not a wizard. I’m a teacher. What I wrote on those parchments were not magic utterances, but polite words. The first word was ‘please’ and the second was ‘thank you’. What our king lacked were good manners. Even though he was a just king, he didn’t speak to his people politely. That’s why his people disobeyed his orders. These polite words will turn any command into a kind, polite request.”

Hidden Beauties in India

India, the largest country in the South Asian region is well known for its diversity in cultures, great personalities such as Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore and for places like Agra and the Himalayas. It is a less known fact that this subcontinent is also rich with a number of places with enchanting scenic beauty that attracts both local and foreign tourists.

Nohkilakai falls (‘Jump of Ki Lakai‘ in the local language) in Cherrapunji is one such place hidden within the dense forests in the East Khasi mountains in the state of Meghalaya. Cherrapunji is one of the wettest areas in the world with an annual rainfall about 1176 cm. This is the tallest plunge waterfall in India

and is fed by the water collected in the plateau above.The pool below has unusually greenish water which makes it more attractive.

Matheran (‘Forest on the forehead of mountains’) Hill station is another favourite among the tourists. It is located in close proximity to Mumbai, the busiest city in the state of Maharashtra.It is 2,625 feet above sea level and declared an eco-sensitive region by the Indian government.

Roads in this area are made of red laterite earth and you can see well preserved old British style buildings too. There are several lookout points in Matheran such as the Panorama point which gives a 360° view of the surrounding area.

Nature inspired Creations

Nature inspires creations. Many incredible creations of scientists and engineers are excellent models of nature. Some of the most wonderful constructions in the world are ideal examples of how nature

had provided inspiration for the designers and architects.

Have you noticed that there is a physical relationship between the aeroplanes and birds? The aeroplane is based not only on the bird’s streamlined body shape, but also on the arrangement of wings and feathers. Leonardo da Vinci analyzed the flight of birds and adapted it for the construction of flying machines.

There are a number of architectural monuments based on nature. The architects have created the Eiffel Tower based on the structure of the human bone tissues. The telegraph poles have the method of wind resistance similar to blades of grass. Joseph Paxton, the designer of the Crystal Palace in London used the leaves of the tropical water lily as his model. Today, house paints, roof tiles and window glasses use

the ‘lotus effect’. This concept is based on the surface of a lotus leaf. As it is covered with a layer of fine fibres, hair and wax crystals, the dust and dirt dissolve in water and roll off, so that the leaf remains clean and dry.

Nature has also influenced the medical world. Diagnosis of diseases through ultra sound is based on the ultra sound that bats use to detect its prey. Even, the flippers that the divers use are based on the webbed feet of frogs.

Similarly, we can list out various creations of man that are based on the structures of nature. By considering all these, we can decide that nature is not only a healer, but also an excellent teacher.

No, no, let us play, for it is yet day, and we cannot go to sleep;besides, in the sky the little birds fly, and the hills are all cover’d with sheep.’ ‘Well, well, go and play till the light fades away, and then go home to bed.’The little ones leap’d and shouted and laugh’d and all the hills echoed.

At the morning assembly, Lahiru spoke about how he spent his vacation with his Japanese pen - friend.

Good morning! Dear sir, teachers and friends, I would like to share a recent experience I had. I spent my last vacation with my Japanese pen friend Kenta Akimoto, whom we affectionately call Ken. Kenta means ‘healthy and strong’. Recently, his parents and his little sister came to Sri Lanka for a short holiday. Now, I’m going to tell you what I learnt about Japan and its people.

Japanese people can be described using several words. They are polite, clean, kind, intelligent, hard-working, respectful and punctual. Their trains are among the world’s most punctual with an average delay of 18 seconds. One of the trains has a speed of nearly 500km/p.h. They are also intelligent and hard-working. They have access to amazing technology. For example, Ken’s father has a water proof mobile phone. My friend even told me that there was a building with a highway passing through it. According to Ken, Japanese people are very strong willed. They experience nearly 1500 earthquakes a year. Despite this experience, they always stand strong.

HopscotchIt is believed that hopscotch was first played in ancient Rome. It can be played alone or with several players. First, children draw a hopscotch grid. The grid consists of numbered rectangles on the floor. Then they toss a small object (e.g. a flat stone) to land on the rectangles and hop and jump through the diagram to retrieve it.

Catch the Dragon’s TailThis game comes from China. Children form a line by placing their hands on the shoulder of the child in front of them. The first child on the line is dragon’s head and the last is the dragon’s tail. The head tries to catch the tail by moving the line. The others try to prevent it without breaking the line. When the head catches the tail, the tail becomes the new head.

Cat’s CradleThis is a string game. Children put their fingers through looped string to create different shapes. They pass the string back and forth to change shapes.

Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts and Crosses)Tic-tac-toe is a paper -and -pencil game. It requires two players. Players draw a 3 x 3 grid on a paper and mark the grids with “x” or “0” marks. The player who is able to mark the grid in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal pattern wins the game.

A City Boy on the Farm

Peter Smith was an Australian boy. He lived in a big city with his parents. Unfortunately, when Peter was eight years old both his parents passed away. So, Peter was sent to live with his uncle and aunt in the country. They owned a farm with a lot of animals.

As Peter had always lived in the city, he was not used to animals. He did not like to go near them. He was afraid of horses the most. They seemed so big and powerful. His uncle noticed this and gave him a small, well mannered horse called Lightfoot. But Peter could not get rid of his fear. Every time he got on the horse, he trembled. He could not ride well. This made his uncle sad because he wanted Peter to inherit the farm after him.

One day Peter’s uncle and aunt had to visit a sick neighbour. The two farm hands, John and Rob, were working in the fields. Peter was left alone in the house. It was a very warm day. There had been no rain for some time. Peter walked towards the garden to get some air. Suddenly, he saw smoke coming out from the field of grass behind the stables. Peter realized it could be the beginning of a forest fire. He knew such fires were dangerous and could burn the land for many miles.

Peter knew the horses were in the stables. He realized he had to save them somehow. Peter began to lead them out one by one, all the time talking to them softly to keep them calm. Finally, the horses were safe in the front field.

But the fire was getting bigger. Peter began to bring buckets of water and throw on the burning grass. The smoke hurt his eyes and he felt tired. Yet he did not stop.

Suddenly, he heard the hooves of a horse and saw John riding into the garden. “Brave boy!” he said. “We saw the smoke and Rob went to get help. But someone must bring the sheep home. Otherwise they might wander off to the forest. Can you ride Lightfoot and bring them back?” John asked. Peter jumped on to the horse and rode to the fields. It was a difficult job and it took a long time. By the time he brought them home, the fire had been put out. His uncle was at the door waiting for him.

“You are a wonder, Peter. You saved my horses,” he said. “Did they hurt you?” He asked.

“No, they didn’t,” Peter said. “And I’m not afraid of them anymore.”

She began to dream of conquering Mount Everest when she saw a photograph of a friend in the Himalayas in 2002. Following in the footsteps of her friend, she followed a mountaineering course which provided her with the necessary skills. After that she climbed several mountains in the world including Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Spanish Pyranees and Argentine Andes. On May 21st, 2016, Jayanthi became the first Sri Lankan to reach the summit of the mighty Everest, realizing her ultimate dream. According to Jayanthi’s family and friends, she possesses a number of outstanding characteristics that guided her through her path to success. They see her as a fearless, methodical person with sheer will power and undying perseverance. During her school days, her mother recalled, that Jayanthi had balanced well both her academic work and sports activities.

In Jayanthi’s view, all the experience she has gained throughout her life helped her in this great achievement. She further says that she had to go through a grueling training including rock climbing, ice-climbing, survival skills and other rigorous physical activities and also the mental strength which helped in increasing the level of endurance. She thanks her mountaineering team, friends and family for their generous support.
