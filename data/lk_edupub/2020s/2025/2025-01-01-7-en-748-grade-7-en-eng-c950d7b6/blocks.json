Reasons for travelling can be for pleasure, gathering information, holidaying and visiting people. Travelling is another way to spend our time meaningfully and enjoyably. It brings about a change in our lives. Climbing a mountain, going for a walk or a boat ride, spending time on a beach or a national park and visiting a museum or a historical place give us new experiences and knowledge. Travelling teaches us to appreciate nature and aesthetic beauty. We can hear the chirping of birds and the songs of the sea, rivers and waterfalls. It creates wonderful memories in our mind.
