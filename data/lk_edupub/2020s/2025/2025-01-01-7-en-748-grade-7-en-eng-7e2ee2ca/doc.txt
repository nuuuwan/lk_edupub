UNIT 02

FRIENDS INDEED

Reading

I’m Fifi. I live in a house made of glass. It’s very clean and spacious. I like to move about in it freely with my friends. My house is decorated with different kinds of aquatic plants, stones and ornaments. It’s like a paradise with colourful lights and decorations. I’m fed with different kinds of tasty food, three times a day. I can play whenever I want to. I have no fear of being attacked by any large fish or being caught in a fishing net. My neighbour, whom I can see through the glass, has a house similar to mine.

We have many visitors every day. They walk past us carrying bags, cameras and some stop to take our pictures. I hear visitors talk of me. They admire my beauty. They say that I’m in a “tank” and they call our house an “aquarium”.

Sometimes, I feel lonely even though I live among a big crowd. Then I think of my parents, my family and relations. I remember the happy days I spent among the beautiful corals, seaweed and large rocks. I often remember the enjoyable playtime I had. My mother would shout at us when we hid among the rocks and the seaweed. She always warned us that they weren’t safe places for us to play. She wanted us to stay with her all the time. My mother’s words still echo in my mind. I still can remember the day when a strong current in the ocean separated me from my friends. However, I know that I cannot go back home because I’m in a zoo.

Read this poem and answer the questions.SnakesA snake can glide from side to side.They’re really long and like to hide. They have long backbones, but no hair.They use their tongues to taste the air.They taste your scent if you are near,And hiss a threat for you to hear.It’s wise of you to clear their way,So you don’t have an awful day!

Activity 5The Tree, the Pencil Maker and the PencilsOnce there lived a young man. He had no livelihood but he was intelligent. One day he went to the jungle to find some food. He found some fruit and ate it. After a while he rested under a shady tree. There he fell asleep. While sleeping, he heard a strange voice.

“Child, listen to me. I am old now. But my trunk is still strong. Take me and use me for a good purpose. I am the oak tree that you are sleeping under. Make sure that you plant another tree in my place.” Then, the tree fell into a deep sleep.The young man woke up and thought for a while. Then, he cut down the tree. After that, he took the oak trunk to the village. He thought of a way to use the oak trunk for a good purpose. He finally decided to make pencils with it.

He was very happy, when he made his first set of pencils. He talked to the pencils before putting them into the box.

“There are 5 things you should know, before you go around the world,” he told the pencils.

“Keep them in your mind forever, so that you will become the best pencils.”
