Some aspects of those technologies that have kept advancing from generation to generation are unique to Sri Lanka. For this reason, such technologies are called traditional technologies. Ancient Lankans constructed buildings and other works that suited the environment and the culture of this country. They are described as architectural creations. Apart from that, they also created forms of arts that suited their thoughts and wishes. A study of all these things helps gain knowledge about the day-to-day life of the ancient Lankans. In this chapter, further information is given about such things which are our heritage.",

After about 3rd century BC, there occurred a rapid growth in the expansion of settlements in the dry zone and consequently, the people of that time faced the challenge of increasing the food production in order to cater to the need of the increasing population. Addressing this challenge, they constructed giant tanks and connected those tanks through canals creating a network of irrigation systems bringing many of the areas under paddy cultivation.",

Similarly, it is seen that small tanks have also been constructed by selecting an area of land of which three sides were bordered with high land and by constructing a bund across the low lying land of the other side so that rain water is collected there. As a lot of labour was not needed for such small constructions, members of a family or the villagers could get together and construct a small tank. As villages spread throughout the dry zone, small tanks required for those small villages were constructed by the villagers themselves under the leadership of the heads of those villages. These are called village tanks. There are stone inscriptions which contain information about some village tanks which are not spoken of in literary sources",

As kings began to be involved in the construction of tanks, bigger tanks which had more capacity than village tanks could be constructed because kings could collect more people than village heads could. By about 3rd century BC, construction of bigger tanks under the patronage of kings had begun. Mahawamsa speaks of three tanks that had been constructed during the reign of King Pandukabhaya. They had been called Jaya Vapi, Abhaya Vapi and Gamini Vapi. It is believed that the tank presently called Basawakkulama was the then Abhaya Vapi. Thissa Wewa in Anuradhapura is considered to have been constructed by King Devanampiyatissa. These are some of the tanks that were constructed about three centuries after the arrival of Prince Vijaya in Lanka. It is clear that those tanks had been small tanks. Basavakkulama and Thissa Wewa are seen in present status after been renovated on several occasions.",

A large-scale tank is a vast reservoir which holds a huge volume of water which is at least 20-30 feet high and spreads over an area of thousands of acres. Further, as the height of the volume of water increases, the water pressure exerted on the dam, too, increases. Many people live in downstream areas of a tank and there also are cultivations.

It is also clear that the width of the dam was determined based on the height and the length of the dam.",

    "text": "Another challenge that was encountered when constructing a tank was to find the labour required for that. Thousands of workers had to be deployed for several years in order to build up a dam of about 30\u201340 feet high over several miles by way of filling soil. It is really wonderful that such mammoth tasks had been fulfilled accurately with human labour so long ago unlike in the present day where modern machinery is used to do such heavy work. When constructing a dam and canals, a proper plan and a good organizing skill were needed in order to carry out various tasks such as finding the required labour, managing the workers, providing food for the workers, carrying the soil and building up the dam by pressing the soil hard. The giant tanks we see today give evidence to the fact that ancient Lankans had succeeded in overcoming all those challenges. It was in response to many such challenges encountered in the construction and maintenance of tanks that various features of a tank such as the sluice, bisokotuwa (a cistern sluice), the breakwater, the inner spill and the outer spill were created.",

It is obvious that the constructors of those canals would have faced various challenges in carrying out such arduous tasks. However, the sources available in this country do not provide sufficient information about how such canals were constructed or about the difficulties the constructors faced. Therefore, some understanding about the technology of constructing canals and bunds at that time has to be gained by studying the nature of the remaining canals and bunds and by studying the ruins of such works.",

In all the ponds found on the rock plains and rock funnels at the ancient monastery complex in Rajagala, a hole has been constructed close to each pond and has been filled with water for the purpose of washing the feet before getting into the pond. It seems that depositing of sand in the pond and adding of dirt into the water had been minimized by this. There also are signs of small cabins that had been constructed for shade close to the ponds. Those who came to bathe had been provided with facilities to get their body cooled by being in the shade before getting into the water. It is evident that ponds had been constructed according to a proper plan with a good understanding of the environmental conditions.",

According to Mahawansa, on the day when the land was prepared for constructing the garden, a heavy rain (Megha) had fallen; hence the garden was given the name \u2018Maha Megha Wana\u2019. Later it became famous as Mahamewuna Gardens. King Devanampiyatissa later offered this garden to Arahat Mahinda and other Bhikkus. When Arahat Mahinda arrived in this country, there existed another garden named \u2018Nandana Uyana\u2019 in Anuradhapura. As Arahat Mahinda preached dhamma being in this garden, it was considered to be a place which made Buddha Sasana shine in the island and therefore it was called Jothi Garden. However, these gardens, which are considered to be the very first gardens of this country, cannot be seen today because of various constructions that were done later in areas related to these gardens and due to the changes that took place with the passage of time. Kings took the lead role in constructing gardens in ancient Lanka. After King Mutseeva\u2019s time, King Kutakannathissa constructed a garden named \u2018Padmasvara\u2019. In addition to them, King Vasabha, King Gotabhaya, King Kasyapa I, King Agbo I and King Parakramabahu I, too, constructed gardens.

The art of making clay pots developed rapidly after man had built houses and established civilizations. Archaeological findings prove that man in ancient civilizations had made clay vessels of different shapes and different sizes for various needs. Cooking pots, plates, cups, water pots and vases are examples for such objects made of clay. With the development of the technology of making clay vessels, people in all civilizations had started adding beauty to those vessels by colouring, painting and drawing patterns on those vessels. Invention of the potter\u2019s wheel brought about a complete transformation in the art of making clay pots.

A ball of clay is placed on the fast rotating disc and clay vessels can be made with a good finishing using the rotating speed and the shape made by the hand.

Wherever the term \u2018renaissance\u2019 is used in this chapter, it refers to the said revival. Similarly, the term \u2018renaissance\u2019 is also used to refer to the dramatic transformation that took place in the fields of art, religion and science in Europe during the period from 14th to 16th centuries. This chapter focuses on the contributory factors that brought about the renaissance; the development that took place in the fields of literature; the progress achieved in art, sculpture and architecture; and the reawakening that occurred in fields of science, medicine, and philosophy.",

As several trading companies from the same country had come to Asia, they began to compete with one another. Further, since they came as small companies, they could neither capture areas in Asia nor overcome the threats posed by the Portuguese. Having realized this situation, the ruler of Holland merged several companies in 1602 and established the Dutch East India Company or the \u2018VOC\u2019 company as a very strong organization. Since then, the VOC company handled all matters relating to Asia on behalf the Dutch.",

They first established several warehouses in the coastal areas of India and began to gradually spread their power to other areas. As a result, India, Burma and Sri Lanka, too, became colonies of the British Empire. By the middle of 17th century, the French had established the French East India Company and had started coming to Asia. Initially they established their warehouses in Pondicherry, Karaikal and Chander Nagar in India and went on to spread their power. In this way, several European nations had arrived in Asia by the end of the 17th century and there arose disputes among themselves in their efforts to spread their political power and to gain dominance in trade in Asia.
