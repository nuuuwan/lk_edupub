Foreword

The educational objectives of the contemporary world are becoming more complex along with the economic, social, cultural and technological development. The learning and teaching process too is changing in relation to human experiences, technological differences, research and new indices. Therefore, it is required to produce the textbook by including subject related information according to the objectives in the syllabus in order to maintain the teaching process by organizing learning experiences that suit to the learner needs. The textbook is not merely a learning tool for the learner. It is a blessing that contributes to obtain a higher education along with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop values and to obtain learning experiences.

The government in its realization of the concept of free education has offered you about 91 textbooks from grades 6-11. I would like to remind you that you should make the maximum use of these textbooks and protect them well. I sincerely hope that this textbook would assist you to obtain the expertise to become a virtuous citizen with a complete personality who would be a valuable asset to the country.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial and writer boards as well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department who have strived to offer this textbook to you.

²²Save all the created web pages in the same folder.

Tiny Little Bee Brain

Bees fly from flower to flower, sipping nectar and collecting grains of pollen. Bees have a special tongue that sucks up the nectar and a crop in their throat for storing it until they get back to the hive, where it is turned into honey to use as food.

Hyperlinks among pages

The two web pages that were created can be linked using a hyperlink.

Step 1 - Identify the web pages that have been created.

i. Bees.htmlii. BeeFacts.html

Let us use the last two sentences of each page as hyperlinks.

Bees.html - More about Bees

BeeFacts.html - Back to Home

Step 2 - Open the Notepad software, open the two files separately. Study how the hyper-link connection is used with the last sentence using the tag <a href> </a>

It is easy to create hyperlinks when files are in the same folder. Therefore, it is essential that all files, images, video clips etc. be saved in the same folder.

Bees.html

<a href="Bees.html"><h4><center>Back to Home</center></h4></a>
