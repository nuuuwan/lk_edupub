    "text": "In order to secure victory in a game of volleyball, blocking the ball is as important as spiking. Blocking, which is an action that should be done against the spiking of the opponents, should take place at the same time the ball has been spiked. When the ball is hit by the opponents, the challenge can be reduced by blocking it at the net. Therefore, as a volleyball player, you should diligently practise the skill of blocking.",
