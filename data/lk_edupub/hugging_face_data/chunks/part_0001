Maintaining ethics of sports\n\nYou must have noticed that the participants of a sporting event always respect each other. When participants in sports follow rules and regulations, they also get used to maintaining social ethics. At the start and finish of a sports competition, the participants should exchange greetings and greet the judges and the audience. For instance, when a competition or a game is over, the members of the opposing teams, regardless of who the winners are, shake hands, hug one another and also show their gratitude to the judges and the audience as well.\n\nAt Berlin Olympics in 1936, Jesse Owens of United States of America and Luz Long of Germany had tied in the men\u2019s long jump marking at 7.87 m by the end of the fourth round. Then Luz Long instructed Jesse Owens on ways of improving the running approach. Finally Jesse Owens won the first place making a final jump of 8.06 m. The two athletes then walked around the playground together amidst the cheers of about 80,000 strong group of spectators."

Maintaining enthusiasm in sports\n\nRules and regulations are very important in maintaining enthusiasm in sports. If sports events are held without abiding by rules and regulations, it will be hard to conduct a fair competition. By acting according to rules, regulations and standards of sports, justice will be served to every participant. When every participant adheres to the same set of rules, each participant gets an equal opportunity to take part in the game keeping up the same spirit from the beginning to the end. When there is adherence to rules and regulations, even the audience will develop confidence in the game. Thus, rules and regulations pave the way for the participants to engage in the game, fans to watch it from the beginning to the end with enthusiasm and accept victory and defeat unquestionably.\n\n3. Maintaining dignity in sports\n\nFigure 6.3\n\nFigure 6.4\n\n114\n\nRules and regulations are also important in maintaining dignity in sports. When the same set of rules is applied to all participants, justice is served to every one. Therefore, participants abide by the rules and regulations establishing fair play, award victory to the most deserving, and maintain the dignity of the sport.\n\n4. Developing personal values\n\nAny sporting event helps its participants to develop personal values such as the ability to accept victory and defeat equally, engage in play adhering to rules and regulations and respect for each other."

Regulating sports to minimize accidents\n\nWhile participating in sporting events, the participants meet with various accidents. These accidents could happen due to several reasons such as the manner in which the game is played, the type of equipment used etc. Therefore, standards have been defined through rules with regard to the use of equipment and participants cannot use equipment as they wish. Rules define the manner in which the participants should play the game.\n\nFor example in cricket, a fast bowler cannot bowl a full toss above waist (this delivery is called a Beamer) and in boxing, boxers should wear headgear and mouth guards.\n\n6. Protecting the rights of participants\n\nRules and regulations safeguard the rights of the participants in sporting events guaranteeing their right to participate, serve justice to every participant and ensure their safety. Rules and regulations have also barred competitors from achieving victory by unfair means and game fixing for other motives.\n\n7. Resolving problems related to sports\n\nIn any sport, participants could face various problems and issues with regard to the manner in which the game is played. Such issues may affect the successful conduct of the sport. Therefore rules and regulations have been spelt out on how disputes should be resolved. This paves way for the successful continuation of the sport.\n\nFigure 6.6 - Head gear for Boxers\n\n116\n\n8. Providing entertainment\n\nWhen playing, participants gain pleasure if the same rules are applied to every participant irrespective of their talents or positions. Every participant will be satisfied with the outcome of the game and be happy.\n\n9. Fair play"

An example that can be cited is the match between Pakistan and West Indies in the ICC Cricket World Cup tournament in 2011. Pakistan had to get four runs to win in the last delivery. The West Indian bowler was running to deliver the last ball, the Pakistani batsman at the bowlers end had walked forward past the crease. At this point, the bowler could have easily run out the Pakistani player and won the match instead he stopped there, held the ball close to the wicket and warned him not to move forward. In the last delivery Pakistan scored the required four runs and won the match. Despite the victory of the Pakistanis, all the spectators and commentators honoured and showed great respect to the West Indian\n\nFigure 6.7\n\n117\n\nbowler who displayed great sportsmanship. What is evident from this example is that such players always expect victory through fair play only.\n\nThese facts make it clear that there should be rules and regulations in sports.

The competitions were held in a beautiful plain close to the city of Pissa on the Alpians in Athens.\n\n\u2022 There are many legends describing the origin of the Olympics, one of which says that Hercules, son of Zeus, the King of Gods, started the Olympics in memory of Zeus.\n\n\u2022 Another legend says that Prince Pelopas who fought against King Onamous to marry the king\u2019s daughter defeated the king and started holding Olympic Games to celebrate his victory.\n\n\u2022 The winners at Olympic Games were awarded a wreath of olive leaves and honoured with great respect that is accorded to heroes.\n\nFigure 6.8\n\n118\n\n\uf03aFor extra knowledge\n\n\u2022 In its early years women were not allowed to take part in the Olympic Games.\n\n\u2022 After the Romans had invaded Greece in 146 A.D, the Olympic Games came under Roman influence. Consequently, games in which men used animals, were added. Emperor Theodosius, who was dissatisfied with the violent nature of those games, banned Olympic Games in 394 A.D.\n\n\u2022 In 1896 A.D, a Frenchman Pierre de Coubertin started the modern Olympic Games.\n\n\u2022 The objective of holding the Olympic Games was to promote world peace and strengthen relationships between nations through the games.\n\n\u2022 Several organizations were created to work for the development of sports and to maintain its dignity; International Olympic Committee is the foremost among them.\n\nList of countries hosting Olympic Games since 1896 Table 6.1YearCountryCity"

Due to the changes that take place during adolescence we face many challenges such as strong emotions, conflicts caused by interpersonal relationships, diseases, accidents, natural disasters, sexual abuse and delinquency. Having a proper understanding about these challenges help us to identify them early, respond effectively and take measures to overcome them. We have discussed some of these challenges in the previous grades.\n\nWe have learnt about certain challenges like diseases, changes taking place in adolescence and social challenges which we naturally face in day-to-day life. In this chapter we will learn about accidents related to sports and day-to-day activities, natural disasters and sexual abuse. We will also learn about the measures that should be taken to prevent such incidents and first aid that can be given to a victim at such times.\n\nSports related injuries\n\nInjuries caused by sports can be divided into two, namely, external injuries and internal injuries. Although injuries are divided into two, in reality they can occur simultaneously. This classification can be applied to other injuries, too.\n\nExternal injuries Internal injuries\n\nBruisesInjury to bonesLacerationsInjury to jointsCutsInjury to musclesPiercingsInjury to ligaments BlistersInjury to nerves and other internal organs\n\nSports injuries can happen due to personal factors and external factors.\n\n10\n\ntable 10.1\n\n191\n\nActivity\uf088\n\nPersonal factors\n\n\u2022 Level of physical fitness not adequate for the sport\u2022 Participating in sports without warm up exercises\u2022 Lack of proper training\u2022 Not taking adequate time to recover after a sport\u2022 Overtraining\u2022 Adopting wrong training methods and techniques\u2022 Taking part in activities that are not age appropriatePoor physical health\u2022 Not taking adequate amounts of water and food.\n\nExternal factors"

Bruises\n\nDamage caused to the external surface of the skin is a bruise. A bruise can be caused when the skin brushes against a rough surface like the ground, a sharp object like the edge of a cable or a thorny bush. A bruise does not cause heavy bleeding. Keeping the affected area clean with some simple treatment would heal the wound.\n\n2. Lacerations\n\nAn irregular tear of the skin (including the full thickness of the skin) is called a laceration. A laceration most often happens with a contusion of the skin that lies just over a bone.\n\nWhen treating a laceration, the injured area can be bandaged with a clean strip of cloth in order to stop bleeding. Sometimes it may need suturing.\n\n192\n\n3. Cuts\n\nA cut is caused by a sharp object. A cut can be either superficial or deep; a deep cut may damage the internal organs. If the cut is deep the affected area should be immobilized using a support to stop the bleeding.\n\n4. Piercing\n\nPiercing could be caused by a sharp tool or a pointed object. While the surface wound caused by piercing may be small in area, the wound can go deep into the body.\n\nWhen the body is pierced, internal haemorrhage (internal bleeding) is most likely to occur rather than external bleeding. Therefore it is very important that the patient seeks medical treatment immediately. If the pointed object is still present in the body, do not attempt to remove it . Seek immediate medical help from a hospital."

Therefore it is very important that the patient seeks medical treatment immediately. If the pointed object is still present in the body, do not attempt to remove it . Seek immediate medical help from a hospital.\n\nIn the case of a contusion, a greater damage could have happened to the organs in the inner part of the affected area than what is seen superficially on the skin. Swelling and reddening of the skin of the affected area could be noticed. A contusion could cause severe pain. Fractures and internal bleeding are also possible. A contusion can be caused by a fall or when hit with a blunt tool. PRICES protocol (a method of immediate treatment for injury) can be used to minimize the effects of a contusion.\n\n6. Blisters\n\nA blister is a painful red swelling on the skin that contains liquid usually formed by burning or friction (e.g: by a new shoe or sports equipment or burn). Usually a blister will heal on its own. However, if it is broken, it can get infected. Blisters should not be covered tightly. Formation of blisters can be prevented by wearing properly designed sportswear and using the same equipment both at practice and the actual events.\n\nImmediately after a burn injury, the affected area should be washed with flowing water. It helps minimize the formation of blisters.\n\n193\n\n\u2022 RICE treatment is a commonly used method of giving first aid for internal injuries. PRICES treatment is a further development of the RICE method.\n\nInternal Injuries\n\n1. Fractures\n\nA fracture is the most common type of injury caused to bones. Bones of the limbs and even the skull can get fractured. A fracture may be open to the outside. When a fracture is suspected, the affected area should be kept immobilized and the patient taken to hospital immediately.\n\n2. Joint injuries"

When a fracture is suspected, the affected area should be kept immobilized and the patient taken to hospital immediately.\n\n2. Joint injuries\n\nLigaments are strong strips of tissue in the body that connect bones together. Ligaments can get damaged in an accident and consequent swelling, pain and lack of proper functioning of the joint can be experienced. In the case of ligament damage, the affected area should be kept immobilized, bandaged and in an elevated position (PRICES treatment).\n\n4. Muscle injuries\n\nPiercing, contusions, cut injuries or fractures can cause injury to muscles. Muscles\n\nPRICES\n\nP - Protection R - RestI - IceC - CompressionE - ElevationS - Support\n\nFigure 10.1\n\n194\n\nmay even tear as a result of muscle strain.\n\nThere are many occasions where athletes / players suffer muscle injury in this manner. It is very important to get proper training and do warm up exercises in order to prevent muscle injuries. Keeping ice on the affected area and resting the affected muscles are the primary treatment for muscle injury. 5. Injuries to nerves and other internal organs\n\nThe most important organ in our body is the brain. Participants in sports like rugby, football, boxing and types of martial arts face a high risk of injury to brain. Concussion, is temporary brain damage caused by a fall or hard knock on the head by another player or an object.\n\nLiver, spleen, and kidneys are among other internal organs which commonly face risk of injury by accidents. Other internal organs may be damaged in sports accidents and consequent internal bleeding may make the patient look pale or even faint. In such situations, the patient should be taken to hospital immediately. 6. Accidents due to the increase of body heat"

Accidents due to the increase of body heat\n\n- cramps- heat strokes- dehydration.\n\nThese conditions can be prevented by taking proper care when planning competitions at suitable times, providing facilities, training and wearing appropriate clothing. eg: in organizing a cross-country running or a marathon, it is best to start the race in the morning when the sun is not strong. It is also important to ensure the availability of water by the roadside (feeding points) for the runners to drink and to cool the body.\n\nIn the case of a participant falling ill due to the increase of body heat, immediate action should be taken to bring down the body temperature to normal level. This can be done by giving ice,cold water to drink and by applying ice and water on the body.\n\nFigure 10.2\n\n195\n\nActivity\uf088 1. Divide the class into two groups.

Road traffic accidents not only endanger the lives of the pedestrians and those travelling in vehicles, but cause great damage to property too. A careful study of the causes for road accidents makes it evident that most of such accidents happen due to negligence, ignorance or mistakes of all road users. Causes of road accidents are varied and can be categorized as follows:\n\nFaults committed by the drivers\n\n\u2022 Not observing road rules\u2022 Driving too fast\u2022 Driving under the influenc of alcohol\u2022 Driving when tired\u2022 Driving under stress\u2022 Parking vehicles obstructing traffic\u2022 Not wearing seat belts / safety helmets\n\nFigure 10.4\n\nCauses of road accidents\n\nCarelessnessIgnorance / lack of proper maintenance\n\nFault of driversFault of pedestrians\n\nTechnical faults of vehicles Poor road conditions\n\nDiagramme 10. 1\n\n197\n\nFaults committed by pedestrians\n\n\u2022 Not following road signs\u2022 Walking in the dark or wearing dark coloured clothes when walking in the dark.\u2022 Walking on the road in groups\u2022 Walking on the left hand side of the road\u2022 Throwing waste matter onto the road\n\nTechnical faults of vehicles\n\n\u2022 Brake failure\u2022 Defunct lamps (head lights or tail lights)\u2022 Tyres of poor condition\n\nPoor road conditions\n\n\u2022 Lack of properly displayed road signs and traffic signals\u2022 Dilapidated roads\u2022 Open uncovered drains on the edge of the road\u2022 Unsafely placed structures on roads (e.g: electricity / telephone poles, water supply systems, buildings, etc.)\u2022 Lack of / defunct street lamps."

The effects of such hazards which result from sudden and longstanding changes in the environment have been aggravated due to human activities\n\n\u2022 Storms \u2022 Landslides\u2022 Earthquakes \u2022 Bushfires\u2022 Tsunami \u2022 Lightning\u2022 Floods \u2022 Droughts\n\nThe areas affected by such disasters, the time of the year in which disasters occur and the frequency of their occurrence vary. It is very difficult to prevent the occurrence of natural disasters. Therefore to mitigate the harmful effects of such disasters, it is very important to have adequate understanding on how they occur, the times and the areas in which they occur. In addition, it is also important to be mindful of the early warnings issued through media and other warning systems.\n\n1. Precautions that can be adopted to mitigate the effects of cyclones\n\n\u2022 Construct houses with strong roofs.\u2022 Remove dangerous trees which are close to houses and buildings.\u2022 Move to a safe place when a warning has been received.\u2022 Cut branches of large trees which lean towards houses/buildings.\u2022 Lie on the ground or move to a place under a concrete roof .\u2022 Refrain from making contact with broken down electric cables.\n\n2.

Mitigating effects of Tsunami\n\nA tsunami is generated by the displacement of a large volume of water in the ocean due to an earthquake or some other seismic activity in the seabed. The water thus displaced travels in the form of waves into the shallow water near the coast. In the deep ocean, a tsunami has a small amplitude (about 1 m), but it grows in height as it reaches the coast (up to about 20 m).\n\nFigure 10.8\n\n204"

Mitigating effects of lightning\n\nLightning could occur in any part of Sri Lanka. Lightning becomes a common phenomenon specially during rainy seasons and inter-monsoonal rains in March, April, October and November.\n\nIntense heat is created by lightning. Therefore, lightning can cause severe burn injuries. Lightning may even cause death due to such burn injuries and shock.\n\nWhen there is lightning;\u2022 Always stay inside a building. Do not stay in open areas like playgrounds, paddy fields and the beach. \u2022 Do not stay close to electricity and telephone poles.\u2022 Do not engage in activities like flying kites, catching fish with a fish rod, climbing trees or plucking fruits with a crook etc. \u2022 Refrain from using metal tools like axes, knives and mamotees. \u2022 Refrain from swimming and sailing.\u2022 Do not use electric equipment and telephones (remove plugs). \u2022 If the electric circuit breaker is switched off due to lightning, do not switch it on until the danger has passed.

Here are some such important situations.\n\n1. When a person has fainted\n\nIf the patient is wearing warm clothing, remove them and put on light clothing. Take the patient to a place with good ventilation. Sponge the armpit and groin areas with lukewarm water. Cold water or hot water should not be used for sponging. The patient should drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. 3. When a person is bleeding\n\nPut a piece of clean cloth on the wound and apply pressure on it or bandage up the area in order to stop bleeding. The injured parts should be kept in an elevated position (higher than the level of the heart). Keep the injured parts immobilized and take the patient to hospital for medical treatment. 4. When a person gets a fit\n\nThe greatest danger that a person who has gone into convulsion is faced is of losing life due to falling, drowning or blocking of airway. When treating a patient with a convulsive (fit), he / she should be made to lie on the left side of his / her body (recovery position )so that the airway does not get blocked with phlegm and vomit. Do not insert anything into the patient\u2019s mouth. Keep any object that could cause danger away from the patient.\n\n5. When a person suffers a concussion\n\nFollow the A,B,C,D,E method described above and take the patient immediately for medical treatment keeping him/her in a posture that is not risky. If the patient is unconscious, he/she should not be given anything to eat or drink.\n\n6. When a person fractures a bone\n\nIf a fracture has occurred or is suspected, support that part to keep it immobilized to\n\nFigure 10.20\n\n213\n\nreduce the pain (e.g: with splints, sling, collar, etc.).\n\n7. When a person dislocates a joint"

When a person dislocates a joint\n\n8. When a person chokes on some object\n\nA person may choke on small objects like parts of a toy or pieces of food. This can obstruct the patient\u2019s breathing and may even cause death. Immediate action should be taken to remove the object that is blocking the airway. The method of doing this varies depending on the age of the patient.\n\nIn the case of a small child, make the child face downward by keeping the upper part of the stomach on the bent knees and give a few blows on the back with the hand.\n\nIn the case of an adult, stand behind the person, put your arms around the waist and tip the person slightly forward. Press hard into the abdomen with a quick, upward thrust as if trying to lift the person up. Repeat thrusts until the block is dislodged. This method is called the Heimlich manoeuvre.\n\nFigure 10.22\n\nFigure 10.21\n\n214\n\n9. When a person has got an object stuck in the nose\n\nTickle the nose (e.g: with a coconut fibre) and make the patient sneeze. The object is most likely to come out. If you fail to get it out do not try to take it out using any equipment. Take the patient immediately to a hospital.\n\n10. Snake bites / animal bites\n\nAn animal bite or a snake bite may cause pain, infection, shock or even death. \u2022 Take measures to allay the patient\u2019s fear.\u2022 Keep the affected area immobilized. (Do not let the patient walk.)\u2022 Wash the area with soap and flowing water.\u2022 Give paracetamol tablets to ease pain. Refrain from giving any other medicine. \u2022 Refrain from giving food items like fruit juice, king coconut or young coconut water which contains high potassium. \u2022 Take the patient immediately to a hospital.\n\nWhat should not be done when giving first aid for animal / snake bites:\n\n\u2022 Using the mouth to suck out the venom. \u2022 Applying tourniquets."

Make separate cards stating each type of injury that a person may suffer due to an accident and the first aid given in each situation. Distribute the cards among the pupils in the class. Ask one pupil to stand up and read the type of injury or the first aid that has been written on his/her card. Ask the pupil who has got the card stating the relevant first aid / injury to stand up and read it. 2. Ask the pupils to demonstrate first aid being given to a person with a particular injury.\n\n217\n\nTransporting a patient\n\nTransporting a patient who suffers injuries as aforesaid should be done very carefully. Lifting the patient or carrying the patient to some other place should be done in a way that the patient does not feel pain or the condition of the patient does not aggravate.\n\n\u2022 When lifting or carrying a person who has had an accident, there is possibility of the spinal cord getting damaged. To prevent this when the patient is being taken to hospital, make him/her lie on a flat surface (e.g: a plank of wood) so that the back and the neck of the patient is not bent.\n\nThe following are some of the ways which can be adopted in transporting patients. These methods can be adopted when carrying a person who suffers injury to a safer place (e.g: out of a fire, out of a pool of water). However, these methods should not be followed when the vertebral column or the neck of the patient has been damaged.\n\nHow a patient should be carried if you are alone\n\n1. Bend down and hold the patient by the shoulders with both your hands."
