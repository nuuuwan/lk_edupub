Maintaining ethics of sports\n\nYou must have noticed that the participants of a sporting event always respect each other. When participants in sports follow rules and regulations, they also get used to maintaining social ethics. At the start and finish of a sports competition, the participants should exchange greetings and greet the judges and the audience. For instance, when a competition or a game is over, the members of the opposing teams, regardless of who the winners are, shake hands, hug one another and also show their gratitude to the judges and the audience as well.\n\nAt Berlin Olympics in 1936, Jesse Owens of United States of America and Luz Long of Germany had tied in the men\u2019s long jump marking at 7.87 m by the end of the fourth round. Then Luz Long instructed Jesse Owens on ways of improving the running approach. Finally Jesse Owens won the first place making a final jump of 8.06 m. The two athletes then walked around the playground together amidst the cheers of about 80,000 strong group of spectators."

Maintaining enthusiasm in sports\n\nRules and regulations are very important in maintaining enthusiasm in sports. If sports events are held without abiding by rules and regulations, it will be hard to conduct a fair competition. By acting according to rules, regulations and standards of sports, justice will be served to every participant. When every participant adheres to the same set of rules, each participant gets an equal opportunity to take part in the game keeping up the same spirit from the beginning to the end. When there is adherence to rules and regulations, even the audience will develop confidence in the game. Thus, rules and regulations pave the way for the participants to engage in the game, fans to watch it from the beginning to the end with enthusiasm and accept victory and defeat unquestionably.\n\n3. Maintaining dignity in sports\n\nFigure 6.3\n\nFigure 6.4\n\n114\n\nRules and regulations are also important in maintaining dignity in sports. When the same set of rules is applied to all participants, justice is served to every one. Therefore, participants abide by the rules and regulations establishing fair play, award victory to the most deserving, and maintain the dignity of the sport.\n\n4. Developing personal values\n\nAny sporting event helps its participants to develop personal values such as the ability to accept victory and defeat equally, engage in play adhering to rules and regulations and respect for each other."

Regulating sports to minimize accidents\n\nWhile participating in sporting events, the participants meet with various accidents. These accidents could happen due to several reasons such as the manner in which the game is played, the type of equipment used etc. Therefore, standards have been defined through rules with regard to the use of equipment and participants cannot use equipment as they wish. Rules define the manner in which the participants should play the game.\n\nFor example in cricket, a fast bowler cannot bowl a full toss above waist (this delivery is called a Beamer) and in boxing, boxers should wear headgear and mouth guards.\n\n6. Protecting the rights of participants\n\nRules and regulations safeguard the rights of the participants in sporting events guaranteeing their right to participate, serve justice to every participant and ensure their safety. Rules and regulations have also barred competitors from achieving victory by unfair means and game fixing for other motives.\n\n7. Resolving problems related to sports\n\nIn any sport, participants could face various problems and issues with regard to the manner in which the game is played. Such issues may affect the successful conduct of the sport. Therefore rules and regulations have been spelt out on how disputes should be resolved. This paves way for the successful continuation of the sport.\n\nFigure 6.6 - Head gear for Boxers\n\n116\n\n8. Providing entertainment\n\nWhen playing, participants gain pleasure if the same rules are applied to every participant irrespective of their talents or positions. Every participant will be satisfied with the outcome of the game and be happy.\n\n9. Fair play"

An example that can be cited is the match between Pakistan and West Indies in the ICC Cricket World Cup tournament in 2011. Pakistan had to get four runs to win in the last delivery. The West Indian bowler was running to deliver the last ball, the Pakistani batsman at the bowlers end had walked forward past the crease. At this point, the bowler could have easily run out the Pakistani player and won the match instead he stopped there, held the ball close to the wicket and warned him not to move forward. In the last delivery Pakistan scored the required four runs and won the match. Despite the victory of the Pakistanis, all the spectators and commentators honoured and showed great respect to the West Indian\n\nFigure 6.7\n\n117\n\nbowler who displayed great sportsmanship. What is evident from this example is that such players always expect victory through fair play only.\n\nThese facts make it clear that there should be rules and regulations in sports.

The competitions were held in a beautiful plain close to the city of Pissa on the Alpians in Athens.\n\n\u2022 There are many legends describing the origin of the Olympics, one of which says that Hercules, son of Zeus, the King of Gods, started the Olympics in memory of Zeus.\n\n\u2022 Another legend says that Prince Pelopas who fought against King Onamous to marry the king\u2019s daughter defeated the king and started holding Olympic Games to celebrate his victory.\n\n\u2022 The winners at Olympic Games were awarded a wreath of olive leaves and honoured with great respect that is accorded to heroes.\n\nFigure 6.8\n\n118\n\n\uf03aFor extra knowledge\n\n\u2022 In its early years women were not allowed to take part in the Olympic Games.\n\n\u2022 After the Romans had invaded Greece in 146 A.D, the Olympic Games came under Roman influence. Consequently, games in which men used animals, were added. Emperor Theodosius, who was dissatisfied with the violent nature of those games, banned Olympic Games in 394 A.D.\n\n\u2022 In 1896 A.D, a Frenchman Pierre de Coubertin started the modern Olympic Games.\n\n\u2022 The objective of holding the Olympic Games was to promote world peace and strengthen relationships between nations through the games.\n\n\u2022 Several organizations were created to work for the development of sports and to maintain its dignity; International Olympic Committee is the foremost among them.\n\nList of countries hosting Olympic Games since 1896 Table 6.1YearCountryCity"

Due to the changes that take place during adolescence we face many challenges such as strong emotions, conflicts caused by interpersonal relationships, diseases, accidents, natural disasters, sexual abuse and delinquency. Having a proper understanding about these challenges help us to identify them early, respond effectively and take measures to overcome them. We have discussed some of these challenges in the previous grades.\n\nWe have learnt about certain challenges like diseases, changes taking place in adolescence and social challenges which we naturally face in day-to-day life. In this chapter we will learn about accidents related to sports and day-to-day activities, natural disasters and sexual abuse. We will also learn about the measures that should be taken to prevent such incidents and first aid that can be given to a victim at such times.\n\nSports related injuries\n\nInjuries caused by sports can be divided into two, namely, external injuries and internal injuries. Although injuries are divided into two, in reality they can occur simultaneously. This classification can be applied to other injuries, too.\n\nExternal injuries Internal injuries\n\nBruisesInjury to bonesLacerationsInjury to jointsCutsInjury to musclesPiercingsInjury to ligaments BlistersInjury to nerves and other internal organs\n\nSports injuries can happen due to personal factors and external factors.\n\n10\n\ntable 10.1\n\n191\n\nActivity\uf088\n\nPersonal factors\n\n\u2022 Level of physical fitness not adequate for the sport\u2022 Participating in sports without warm up exercises\u2022 Lack of proper training\u2022 Not taking adequate time to recover after a sport\u2022 Overtraining\u2022 Adopting wrong training methods and techniques\u2022 Taking part in activities that are not age appropriatePoor physical health\u2022 Not taking adequate amounts of water and food.\n\nExternal factors"

Bruises\n\nDamage caused to the external surface of the skin is a bruise. A bruise can be caused when the skin brushes against a rough surface like the ground, a sharp object like the edge of a cable or a thorny bush. A bruise does not cause heavy bleeding. Keeping the affected area clean with some simple treatment would heal the wound.\n\n2. Lacerations\n\nAn irregular tear of the skin (including the full thickness of the skin) is called a laceration. A laceration most often happens with a contusion of the skin that lies just over a bone.\n\nWhen treating a laceration, the injured area can be bandaged with a clean strip of cloth in order to stop bleeding. Sometimes it may need suturing.\n\n192\n\n3. Cuts\n\nA cut is caused by a sharp object. A cut can be either superficial or deep; a deep cut may damage the internal organs. If the cut is deep the affected area should be immobilized using a support to stop the bleeding.\n\n4. Piercing\n\nPiercing could be caused by a sharp tool or a pointed object. While the surface wound caused by piercing may be small in area, the wound can go deep into the body.\n\nWhen the body is pierced, internal haemorrhage (internal bleeding) is most likely to occur rather than external bleeding. Therefore it is very important that the patient seeks medical treatment immediately. If the pointed object is still present in the body, do not attempt to remove it . Seek immediate medical help from a hospital."

Therefore it is very important that the patient seeks medical treatment immediately. If the pointed object is still present in the body, do not attempt to remove it . Seek immediate medical help from a hospital.\n\nIn the case of a contusion, a greater damage could have happened to the organs in the inner part of the affected area than what is seen superficially on the skin. Swelling and reddening of the skin of the affected area could be noticed. A contusion could cause severe pain. Fractures and internal bleeding are also possible. A contusion can be caused by a fall or when hit with a blunt tool. PRICES protocol (a method of immediate treatment for injury) can be used to minimize the effects of a contusion.\n\n6. Blisters\n\nA blister is a painful red swelling on the skin that contains liquid usually formed by burning or friction (e.g: by a new shoe or sports equipment or burn). Usually a blister will heal on its own. However, if it is broken, it can get infected. Blisters should not be covered tightly. Formation of blisters can be prevented by wearing properly designed sportswear and using the same equipment both at practice and the actual events.\n\nImmediately after a burn injury, the affected area should be washed with flowing water. It helps minimize the formation of blisters.\n\n193\n\n\u2022 RICE treatment is a commonly used method of giving first aid for internal injuries. PRICES treatment is a further development of the RICE method.\n\nInternal Injuries\n\n1. Fractures\n\nA fracture is the most common type of injury caused to bones. Bones of the limbs and even the skull can get fractured. A fracture may be open to the outside. When a fracture is suspected, the affected area should be kept immobilized and the patient taken to hospital immediately.\n\n2. Joint injuries"

When a fracture is suspected, the affected area should be kept immobilized and the patient taken to hospital immediately.\n\n2. Joint injuries\n\nLigaments are strong strips of tissue in the body that connect bones together. Ligaments can get damaged in an accident and consequent swelling, pain and lack of proper functioning of the joint can be experienced. In the case of ligament damage, the affected area should be kept immobilized, bandaged and in an elevated position (PRICES treatment).\n\n4. Muscle injuries\n\nPiercing, contusions, cut injuries or fractures can cause injury to muscles. Muscles\n\nPRICES\n\nP - Protection R - RestI - IceC - CompressionE - ElevationS - Support\n\nFigure 10.1\n\n194\n\nmay even tear as a result of muscle strain.\n\nThere are many occasions where athletes / players suffer muscle injury in this manner. It is very important to get proper training and do warm up exercises in order to prevent muscle injuries. Keeping ice on the affected area and resting the affected muscles are the primary treatment for muscle injury. 5. Injuries to nerves and other internal organs\n\nThe most important organ in our body is the brain. Participants in sports like rugby, football, boxing and types of martial arts face a high risk of injury to brain. Concussion, is temporary brain damage caused by a fall or hard knock on the head by another player or an object.\n\nLiver, spleen, and kidneys are among other internal organs which commonly face risk of injury by accidents. Other internal organs may be damaged in sports accidents and consequent internal bleeding may make the patient look pale or even faint. In such situations, the patient should be taken to hospital immediately. 6. Accidents due to the increase of body heat"

Accidents due to the increase of body heat\n\n- cramps- heat strokes- dehydration.\n\nThese conditions can be prevented by taking proper care when planning competitions at suitable times, providing facilities, training and wearing appropriate clothing. eg: in organizing a cross-country running or a marathon, it is best to start the race in the morning when the sun is not strong. It is also important to ensure the availability of water by the roadside (feeding points) for the runners to drink and to cool the body.\n\nIn the case of a participant falling ill due to the increase of body heat, immediate action should be taken to bring down the body temperature to normal level. This can be done by giving ice,cold water to drink and by applying ice and water on the body.\n\nFigure 10.2\n\n195\n\nActivity\uf088 1. Divide the class into two groups.

Road traffic accidents not only endanger the lives of the pedestrians and those travelling in vehicles, but cause great damage to property too. A careful study of the causes for road accidents makes it evident that most of such accidents happen due to negligence, ignorance or mistakes of all road users. Causes of road accidents are varied and can be categorized as follows:\n\nFaults committed by the drivers\n\n\u2022 Not observing road rules\u2022 Driving too fast\u2022 Driving under the influenc of alcohol\u2022 Driving when tired\u2022 Driving under stress\u2022 Parking vehicles obstructing traffic\u2022 Not wearing seat belts / safety helmets\n\nFigure 10.4\n\nCauses of road accidents\n\nCarelessnessIgnorance / lack of proper maintenance\n\nFault of driversFault of pedestrians\n\nTechnical faults of vehicles Poor road conditions\n\nDiagramme 10. 1\n\n197\n\nFaults committed by pedestrians\n\n\u2022 Not following road signs\u2022 Walking in the dark or wearing dark coloured clothes when walking in the dark.\u2022 Walking on the road in groups\u2022 Walking on the left hand side of the road\u2022 Throwing waste matter onto the road\n\nTechnical faults of vehicles\n\n\u2022 Brake failure\u2022 Defunct lamps (head lights or tail lights)\u2022 Tyres of poor condition\n\nPoor road conditions\n\n\u2022 Lack of properly displayed road signs and traffic signals\u2022 Dilapidated roads\u2022 Open uncovered drains on the edge of the road\u2022 Unsafely placed structures on roads (e.g: electricity / telephone poles, water supply systems, buildings, etc.)\u2022 Lack of / defunct street lamps."

The effects of such hazards which result from sudden and longstanding changes in the environment have been aggravated due to human activities\n\n\u2022 Storms \u2022 Landslides\u2022 Earthquakes \u2022 Bushfires\u2022 Tsunami \u2022 Lightning\u2022 Floods \u2022 Droughts\n\nThe areas affected by such disasters, the time of the year in which disasters occur and the frequency of their occurrence vary. It is very difficult to prevent the occurrence of natural disasters. Therefore to mitigate the harmful effects of such disasters, it is very important to have adequate understanding on how they occur, the times and the areas in which they occur. In addition, it is also important to be mindful of the early warnings issued through media and other warning systems.\n\n1. Precautions that can be adopted to mitigate the effects of cyclones\n\n\u2022 Construct houses with strong roofs.\u2022 Remove dangerous trees which are close to houses and buildings.\u2022 Move to a safe place when a warning has been received.\u2022 Cut branches of large trees which lean towards houses/buildings.\u2022 Lie on the ground or move to a place under a concrete roof .\u2022 Refrain from making contact with broken down electric cables.\n\n2.

Mitigating effects of Tsunami\n\nA tsunami is generated by the displacement of a large volume of water in the ocean due to an earthquake or some other seismic activity in the seabed. The water thus displaced travels in the form of waves into the shallow water near the coast. In the deep ocean, a tsunami has a small amplitude (about 1 m), but it grows in height as it reaches the coast (up to about 20 m).\n\nFigure 10.8\n\n204"

Mitigating effects of lightning\n\nLightning could occur in any part of Sri Lanka. Lightning becomes a common phenomenon specially during rainy seasons and inter-monsoonal rains in March, April, October and November.\n\nIntense heat is created by lightning. Therefore, lightning can cause severe burn injuries. Lightning may even cause death due to such burn injuries and shock.\n\nWhen there is lightning;\u2022 Always stay inside a building. Do not stay in open areas like playgrounds, paddy fields and the beach. \u2022 Do not stay close to electricity and telephone poles.\u2022 Do not engage in activities like flying kites, catching fish with a fish rod, climbing trees or plucking fruits with a crook etc. \u2022 Refrain from using metal tools like axes, knives and mamotees. \u2022 Refrain from swimming and sailing.\u2022 Do not use electric equipment and telephones (remove plugs). \u2022 If the electric circuit breaker is switched off due to lightning, do not switch it on until the danger has passed.

Here are some such important situations.\n\n1. When a person has fainted\n\nIf the patient is wearing warm clothing, remove them and put on light clothing. Take the patient to a place with good ventilation. Sponge the armpit and groin areas with lukewarm water. Cold water or hot water should not be used for sponging. The patient should drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. 3. When a person is bleeding\n\nPut a piece of clean cloth on the wound and apply pressure on it or bandage up the area in order to stop bleeding. The injured parts should be kept in an elevated position (higher than the level of the heart). Keep the injured parts immobilized and take the patient to hospital for medical treatment. 4. When a person gets a fit\n\nThe greatest danger that a person who has gone into convulsion is faced is of losing life due to falling, drowning or blocking of airway. When treating a patient with a convulsive (fit), he / she should be made to lie on the left side of his / her body (recovery position )so that the airway does not get blocked with phlegm and vomit. Do not insert anything into the patient\u2019s mouth. Keep any object that could cause danger away from the patient.\n\n5. When a person suffers a concussion\n\nFollow the A,B,C,D,E method described above and take the patient immediately for medical treatment keeping him/her in a posture that is not risky. If the patient is unconscious, he/she should not be given anything to eat or drink.\n\n6. When a person fractures a bone\n\nIf a fracture has occurred or is suspected, support that part to keep it immobilized to\n\nFigure 10.20\n\n213\n\nreduce the pain (e.g: with splints, sling, collar, etc.).\n\n7. When a person dislocates a joint"

When a person dislocates a joint\n\n8. When a person chokes on some object\n\nA person may choke on small objects like parts of a toy or pieces of food. This can obstruct the patient\u2019s breathing and may even cause death. Immediate action should be taken to remove the object that is blocking the airway. The method of doing this varies depending on the age of the patient.\n\nIn the case of a small child, make the child face downward by keeping the upper part of the stomach on the bent knees and give a few blows on the back with the hand.\n\nIn the case of an adult, stand behind the person, put your arms around the waist and tip the person slightly forward. Press hard into the abdomen with a quick, upward thrust as if trying to lift the person up. Repeat thrusts until the block is dislodged. This method is called the Heimlich manoeuvre.\n\nFigure 10.22\n\nFigure 10.21\n\n214\n\n9. When a person has got an object stuck in the nose\n\nTickle the nose (e.g: with a coconut fibre) and make the patient sneeze. The object is most likely to come out. If you fail to get it out do not try to take it out using any equipment. Take the patient immediately to a hospital.\n\n10. Snake bites / animal bites\n\nAn animal bite or a snake bite may cause pain, infection, shock or even death. \u2022 Take measures to allay the patient\u2019s fear.\u2022 Keep the affected area immobilized. (Do not let the patient walk.)\u2022 Wash the area with soap and flowing water.\u2022 Give paracetamol tablets to ease pain. Refrain from giving any other medicine. \u2022 Refrain from giving food items like fruit juice, king coconut or young coconut water which contains high potassium. \u2022 Take the patient immediately to a hospital.\n\nWhat should not be done when giving first aid for animal / snake bites:\n\n\u2022 Using the mouth to suck out the venom. \u2022 Applying tourniquets."

Make separate cards stating each type of injury that a person may suffer due to an accident and the first aid given in each situation. Distribute the cards among the pupils in the class. Ask one pupil to stand up and read the type of injury or the first aid that has been written on his/her card. Ask the pupil who has got the card stating the relevant first aid / injury to stand up and read it. 2. Ask the pupils to demonstrate first aid being given to a person with a particular injury.\n\n217\n\nTransporting a patient\n\nTransporting a patient who suffers injuries as aforesaid should be done very carefully. Lifting the patient or carrying the patient to some other place should be done in a way that the patient does not feel pain or the condition of the patient does not aggravate.\n\n\u2022 When lifting or carrying a person who has had an accident, there is possibility of the spinal cord getting damaged. To prevent this when the patient is being taken to hospital, make him/her lie on a flat surface (e.g: a plank of wood) so that the back and the neck of the patient is not bent.\n\nThe following are some of the ways which can be adopted in transporting patients. These methods can be adopted when carrying a person who suffers injury to a safer place (e.g: out of a fire, out of a pool of water). However, these methods should not be followed when the vertebral column or the neck of the patient has been damaged.\n\nHow a patient should be carried if you are alone\n\n1. Bend down and hold the patient by the shoulders with both your hands."

Explain how the Palmyra palm is useful to the people of Jaffna\n\npeninsula.\n\nLandscape of the coastal belt\n\nThe coastal belt that runs around Sri Lanka with physical features like islands, bays, lagoons, points and marshes possesses a unique landscape. The mangroves that grow along the coast, coral reefs as well as attractive sand sheets are basic features of this landscape. A human landscape built on this physical landscape can also be seen.\n\n\u00b2\u00b2 The attractive coastal areas like Tangalle, Hambantota, Pasi\n\nkuda, Unawatuna, Arugam Bay and beautiful coral reefs at Hikkaduwa have attracted the tourists. Hotels, restaurants archaeological places, light houses, religious centers, sanctuaries, recreational centers and national forest reserves persuade tourists to visit this zone frequently.\n\n\u00b2\u00b2 The fishing industry conducted in shallow sea along the coast\n\nand in lagoons, mangrove marshes and fishing settlements distributed along the coastal belt are also the features specific to this zone.\n\n41For Free Distribution\n\n\u00b2\u00b2 Various industries carried out based on the resources found in\n\nthe coastal area are also a special feature of human landscape.

Name other map books in use.\n\n61For Free Distribution\n\nDirection.\n\nShowing the direction on any map is compulsory. But figure of direction is not shown on some maps in map books. On such occasions, the direction where the heading of the map is shown is considered as North and other directions are determined accordingly. A map can be oriented accurately when the directions of the map are set correctly to the corresponding directions of the mapped area. Accordingly, from the place where you stay, the directions of the places marked on the map can be identified correctly.\n\nScale.\n\nIt is impossible to draw all the things found on the land at the same size on the map. In map books scale of each map is given.According to the scale, the size of the map too is changed. The differences among the scales could be understood further when the scale of wall map in the school and the scales found in map books are compared. According to the need, the map drawn may be large or small.\n\nActivity"

According to the available information, the Earth is the only planet that consists of air and water with a congenial environment for living beings.\n\nThe Earth revolves round the Sun while spinning around its own axis. The Earth\u2019s movement around its own axis is called rotation and\n\nthe journey around the Sun is called revolution. The Earth takes 24 hours or one day to rotate around its own axis and 365 days or one year to revolve around the Sun.\n\nThe main objective of this chapter is to study about the Earth related to information about continents, oceans,\n\nlongitudes, latitudes and the shape of\n\nthe Earth.\n\nFig. 1.1 - Rotation of the earth\n\nThe Planet Earth We Live\n\nThe shape of the Earth\n\nThere were different ideas about the shape of the Earth in the past. At present, the Earth has definitely been identified as a spherical object. This is proved by observing the photographs taken from space.

It is also a limited resource. Even though 70% of the surface of the earth is covered with water, only less than 1% of that quantity can be utilized as drinking water. Sri Lanka is an island situated in the Indian Ocean. Although it has many rivers, streams and inland reservoirs, only a limited quantity of such water can be used for drinking. Therefore, the government has to provide water for drinking, as well as for other purposes.\n\nReasons for the requirement of supply of water as a public service\n\n\u00b2Water resource is not sufficiently available in common to satisfy the requirements of all the regions of the island.\n\n\u00b2Due to various reasons, underground water and water in the rivers are polluted.\n\ne.g.- Use of agrochemicals, chemical fertilizers and waste matter released to water sources by factories\n\n\u00b2Density of population in the urban areas\n\n\u00b2With the increase of population, land has to be divided into small plots causing difficulty in digging wells for clean water.\n\n\u00b2Facing scarcity of water in various parts of the country during the periods of droughts.\n\nNational Water Supply and Drainage Board supplies drinking water to many parts of the country. It supplies water to consumers at concessionary rates. Water Supply and Drainage Board strives hard to make water suitable for human consumption. Water is supplied to industries, gardens, etc too."

Observe your face with a mirror to see how your facial expressions change when feel happy, sad, fearful or angry. Your body expressions in such situations may be crying, laughing, frowning, being silent, being frightened, being disappointed and being lethargic. Good emotions are delightful for oneself as well as for the society. However, if unfavourable emotions are not properly manipulated, they will cause harm not only to you but to the society too. For example, a person raged with anger may tend to scold others, assault them, destroy property and even cause death.

The cyclone that entered Sri Lanka on the 24th November 1978 took away 900 human lives and caused much damage to property as well.\n\nMeasures to be taken towards safety during a storm\n\n\u00b2withdraw from affected areas\n\n\u00b2go to a protected place\n\n\u00b2take away a pre-arranged pack which consists of essential and light items with\n\n-bottles of water\n\n-biscuits\n\n-a torch\n\n-a battery operated radio.\n\nIf you are staying at home:\n\n\u00b2check whether the walls and the roof are safe.\n\n\u00b2remove all trees and branches of trees that can be harmful to the house.\n\n\u00b2disconnect electricity.\n\nFor free distribution73\n\nThunder storms\n\nThunder and lightening is a natural phenomenon. Thunder follows lightening. Lightening occurs when the water present in the high cumulonimbus (storm clouds) gets charged due to speedy powerful air waves that keep running up and by rubbing water droplets each other. Positive charges collect in the top layers of the cloud and negative charges collect in the bottom layers. An electrical discharge occurs when the amount of charges reach a certain level. It is known as lightening and thundering. The rise in temperature during day time and convection during the months, March \u2013 April, October \u2013 November cause heavy thunder storms. However, there can be thunder storms at any time of the year.\n\nHow can the damage of a thunder-storm be avoided?\n\nIn a rainy situations:\n\n\u00b2avoid isolated open spaces, places or tall trees\n\n\u00b2avoid horse riding, riding bicycles and travelling on tractors. (open vehicles)\n\n\u00b2refrain from using telephones\n\n\u00b2refrain from touching metal items\n\n\u00b2unplug electric items from plug points"

When a tsunami occurs, powerful waves that originate in sea water spread in all directions. These waves cause a lot of damages to the coastal areas.\n\n74For free distribution\n\nIn history, the Tsunami disaster that took place on the 26th of December 2004 was the most destructive disaster that ever happened in this region. Approximately 31,500 people who lived in coastal areas, including passengers travelling in vehicles like buses, vans, cars and even in a train lost their lives from this disaster unexpectedly arrived. Around 550,000 people were displaced. Houses, tourist hotels, fishing harbours and boats, vehicles and other properties were heavily damaged. It directly affected the coastal areas of Sri Lanka and other countries such as India, Indonesia and Thailand.\n\nHuman activities affected to heighten destruction in the Tsunami\n\n\u2022 Removal of natural vegetation in the coastal areas\n\n\u2022 Destruction of mangroves\n\n\u2022 Damage to coral reefs\n\n\u2022 Removal of sand bars in coastal areas\n\nMeasures to be taken to minimize damages caused by the Tsunami\n\n\u2022 Pay attention to the announcements given by the media\n\n\u2022 Withdraw from the affected areas when warnings have been issued.\n\n\u2022 Make others aware\n\n\u2022 Be alert on the signs of a Tsunami\n\n\u2022 Rush to a safe area immediately\n\n\u2022 Be aware of large tidal waves that can emerge at once and disappear\n\nDrought\n\nAnimals affected by drought"

But the resources available to fulfill these needs are limited. Besides, it is the responsibility of the modern generation to leave behind resources for future generations too. Therefore, we must all get used to affordable life styles which mean to follow a life style and consumption style to match one's own economic level. Our ancestors invariably used to an affordable or simple lifestyles and consumption patterns. They were greatly satisfied with their basic needs: food, shelter and clothing. They used very simple tools with their everyday activities. Yet, the world went through timely changes and our ancestors too had to fall in line. Then, they had to make adjustments to suit their lifestyles. However, such adjustments brought no harmful changes to their lifestyle, society, environment or culture.\n\nCycling to work place\n\nBicycle : eco-friendly and economic family vehicle\n\nIn addition to the basic needs, our parents and grand parents used bicycles, two-wheeled tractors and made economical use of firewood with their hearths. The bicycle came to be the most friendly to the family. The bicycle was used for both travelling and the transport of goods. Even the most developed countries in the world still use the bicycle as an environmental friendly means of transport. Japan is a good example in this connection.\n\nThe Japanese use a bicycle to attend to most of their needs. The bicycle is widely used in Japan. Using a bicycle does not show or imply any social discrimination.\n\nThe two wheeled tractor is an environmentally friendly equipment used by man. It was very helpful for agricultural purposes. The two wheeled tractor that was used for both travelling and agricultural purposes was a very useful equipment in the past."

Therefore, even if they did not get things, they felt that those to be born in the future, needed to be provided for. They believed they could make use, while preserving for future.

This theory is common to all living and non-living things of this world. Problems and challenges are also the same. Problems are something relative. Something that may become a problem to one may not be a problem to another. For an example, though crossing a river is a problem to a rabbit, it is not a problem to a tortoise. Yet, running with a rabbit is a problem to a tortoise. In the same manner, while running fast becomes a problem to a tortoise, it is not a problem to a rabbit. Accordingly, a problem may be relative to person and situation.\n\nFor free distribution105\n\nA problem can be defined as a barrier or an obstacle that blocks reaching a certain activity, condition or situation. It can be defined simply, as the gap between the situation of any moment and inability to achieve one's expectations as precise as one expected."

Although there are various professions in the society, majority prefer employment with high social recognition. Yet, every employment is equally important to the society.

Labourers with special training or have special skills are skilled labourers. The level of skilled labour cannot be attained merely by the knowledge acquired through education. Following a special training relevant to the particular profession is necessary to become a skilled labourer. A training can be defined as providing professional experience and competencies relevant to a particular occupation.\n\nConsider the following examples;\n\n\uf0d8 Giving a special practical training under a specialist to a House Officer (Medical graduate under training)\n\n\uf0d8 Prior to granting of driving licence, drivers must get a special training and pass a practical test.\n\nFor free distribution127\n\n\uf0d8 Giving all the teachers a special training relevant to teaching and frequent in-service training\n\nMany people believe that no training is needed to perform physical labour. But, even in a factory, by giving a special training regarding the operation of the machinery, efficiency of the workers can be increased.\n\nTwo ways for training for employment\n\n1. Pre Service Training - Training given prior to recruitment\n\ne.g. Training given in Technical Colleges on house wiring, teacher training given at Colleges of Education\n\n2.

When the current flowing through the conductor is high, more heat is generated.Resistance of a conductor depends on the material it is made of, its length and its thickness (area of cross section).Therefore, very thin, long nichrome wires are used in electrical appliances in which, heat is generated using heating effect of electricity.

Various methods are used to avoid damages that happen due to the heat generated in them. e.g.:-\n\nCooling fansHeat sink Figure 10.32\n\nFor extra knowledge\n\nNichrome is an alloy. It is made by mixing nickel, chromium and iron.\n\nScience | Electricity 35\n\n10.6 Light effect of electric current\n\nJunctions of most junction diodes get heated when electric current flows through them. It happens because part of the electric energy is emitted as heat energy at the junction.\n\nIn some junction diodes, part of the electric energy is emitted as light energy at the junction. Then, the junction is illuminated. This emission of part of the electric energy as light energy is known as the light effect of electric current. Such diodes that emit light are known as Light emitting diodes (LED).\n\nActivity 10.12\n\nYou will need:- Several LEDs of various colours (red, green, blue), a multicolour LED, connecting wires, a switch, two dry cells\n\nFigure 10.33\n\nMethod:-\n\n\u00b2\u00b2Prepare the circuit by connecting an LED, the switch and two dry cells using connecting wire as shown in Figure 10.33.\u00b2\u00b2Close the switch and observe the LED.\u00b2\u00b2Connect each LED to the circuit and observe the colour of light emitting.\n\nVarious light emitting diodes\n\nLight emitting diodes emit various colours of light. Colour of the light emitted depends on the compound used to make the junction of LED.\n\nSome LEDs emit several colours. They are known as multi colour LEDs.\n\nLEDs are used for light decorative purposes as well as indicators to show whether circuit equipment are in active mode.\n\nThere is a high demand for lamps made of LEDs than for other types of electric lamps and bulbs because of the prevailing energy crisis. The reason for this is the higher efficiency of LED lamps, than the other types of lamps.\n\nScience | Electricity36\n\nFigure 10.34 shows an LED and its circuit\n\n\u00ac-\n\nFigure 10.34\n\nsymbol."

Voltage supplied should exceed that minimum value for the LED to light it up.\n\n10.7 Magnetic effect of electric current\n\nYou may have seen that iron nails and pins are attracted to a magnet. Same way you can see that the indicator is deflected when a compass is brought colse to a magnet.\n\nWhen a compass is kept close to a current carrying conductor also, its indicator deflects. When the current flowing through the conductor is stopped, indicator of the compass returns to its initial position. It happens because a magnetic field is generated by an electric current carrying conductor. This phenomenon is known as the magnetic effect of electric current.\n\nActivity 10.13\n\nYou will need:- A compass, a piece of plank 20 cm x 5 cm, two iron nails, copper wire, a dry cell, a bulb, a switch\n\nMethod:-\n\n\u00b2\u00b2Fix two iron nails at the corners of the piece of plank as shown in Figure 10.35.\n\n\u00b2\u00b2Stretch well and tie the copper wire to the nails. Connect the two ends of the copper wire to the bulb to the dry cell and to the switch as shown in Figure.\n\n\u00b2\u00b2Place the compass under the stretched copper wire. Turn the wire to north-south direction of the earth. So, that the copper wire and the compass needle will be parallel to each other.\n\nFigure 10.35\n\nScience | Electricity 37\n\n\u00b2\u00b2Now, close the switch.

It acts as the vector of different diseases that human suffers such as dengue, malaria etc.To control the disease vector it is important to know about the life cycle of the organism.\n\nFigure 12.15 Life cycle of mosquito\n\nAdult mosquito\n\nLarva\n\nEggs\n\nPupa\n\nAssignment 12.7\n\n\u2022 List out some diseases that are transmitted by mosquito.\u2022 Collect information about fish species that prey on mosquito larvae.\u2022 List the most suitable methods that can be used to control the adult mosquito.\u2022 What are the precautions that can be taken to prevent mosquito breeding ?\u2022 Design a poster about controlling mosquito breeding.\n\n12.3.3 Life cycles for conservation of biodiversity\n\nSome stages within the life cycles of some animal species have become threatened within their habitat. Some growth stages of animals can be completely destroyed due to becoming victims of animals, unfavourable environmental conditions and scarcity of food. Such stages can be considered as the sensitive stage of the particular organism. A species may face total extinction if the sensitive stage is destroyed.\n\nScience | Life cycles of living organisms77\n\nValubale stages of some animals are given below.\n\n\u00b2\u00b2Some insects- Larvae\n\n\u00b2\u00b2Fishes\n\n\u00b2\u00b2Turtles\n\n\u00b2\u00b2Frogs\n\n- Eggs- Eggs and young turtles- Eggs and tadpoles\n\nTo protect the biodiversity it is important to understand about sensitive stages of particular organisms.

Therefore, ball is rotating in circular path at a constant speed.\n\nScience | Phenomena and exploration associated with solar system 103\n\nCorresponding to the example given in Figure 14.8, revolution of planets around the sun also, can be explained. Comparative to the force applied by the arm towards the ball, a force is applied by the sun towards the planet that is called gravitational force. The planet should fall on the sun and be destroyed, due to this force. But, this does not happen because of the constant speed of revolution of the planet around the sun.\n\n14.2 Occurance of seasonal changes\n\nSeasonal changes is a phenomenon that occur due to the revolution of the earth around the sun, with a tilt to its orbital plane.\n\nWhen it is the winter in England which is in the northern hemisphere of the earth it is the summer in Newzealand which is in the southern hemisphere. Let us find out how this happens.\n\nIt is known that the earth's axis has a tilt of 23.5o to its orbilal plane. Revolution of the earth with this tilt is the reason for seasonal changes on earth. Let us study how this happens.\n\nFigure 14.9 Occurance of seasonal changes on earth\n\nMarch 21\n\nJune 21\n\nSeptember 23\n\nDecember 22\n\nConsider the position of the earth (Figure 14.9) on 21st of June.

Rays of the sun falls perpendicular to southern hemisphere, and with an inclination to nothern hemisphere. Therefore, winter occur in nothern hemisphere and summer to the southern hemisphere.\n\nSeasonal changes are distinct in polar regions. Countries like Sri Lanka, which are closer to equator, have no distinct seasonal changes.\n\n14.3 Occurance of phases of moon\n\nPhases of moon occur because of the revolution of moon around the earth. Half of the moon is always illuminated by the light of the sun. But that half is completely seen from the earth only on a full moon day. The part of the illuminated half of the moon, seen from the earth, changes daily due to its position. Thus, we can see various shapes or the phases of the moon.\n\nLet us do Activity 14.4 to study how phase of moon occured.\n\nActivity 14.4\n\nYou will need :- An electric bulb, a styrofoam ball fixed to a rod\n\nMethod:-\n\n\u00b2\u00b2 Use the electric bulb instead of the sun and the styrofoam ball fixed to a rod, instead of moon.

There are two types of eclipses.\n\n\u00b2\u00b2Solar eclipses\u00b2\u00b2Lunar eclipses\n\nSolar eclipses\n\nThe moon revolves around the earth once every 27.3 days. During this journey in some occasions the shadow of the moon falls on the earth. The sun is invisible, fully or partially, to those who are in the shadow area for some time. This is called the solar eclipse. We see the sun and the moon equal in size, in the sky. The sun is a very large object. Moon is very small with respect to the sun. But, the sun is very far away from the earth and the moon. That is why we see them more or less equal in size.\n\nBecause of this reason the moon can totally cover the sun during a solar eclipse. Two areas can be identified in the shadow of moon, fallen on the earth. These areas are the umbra and the penumbra. (Figure 14.13)\n\nSun\n\nMoon\n\nPenumbra\n\nEarth\n\nUmbra\n\nFigure 14.13 A solar eclipse\n\nThose who are in the umbra can see a total solar eclipse, while those who are in the penumbra can see a partial solar eclipse."

This incident can be observed with your naked eyes. As a science student, it is very important for you to observe this. During a total lunar eclipse, moon can be observed in reddish brown colour. It lasts more than an hour (Figure 14.17).\n\nPartial lunar eclipse\n\nInstance in which a part of the moon is in the umbra of the earth and other part is in penumbra is called partial lunar eclipse. Here, the part of the moon in the umbra is seen in reddish brown colour (Figure 14.18).\n\nPartial lunar eclipse occurs"

If you see a falling of star like object it may be a meteor. Communication satellites\n\nSir Arther C. Clerke came out with a new idea on communication by satellites. He said that if a satellite is orbited around the earth at the same speed as the speed of earth's rotation and at a certain height, it will be seen stationary from the earth. Such a satellite is called a Geo-stationary satellite. Sir Arther C. Clerke clarified that if three of such satellites are positioned around the earth, the whole globe can be covered with communication facilities.\n\nScience | Phenomena and exploration associated with solar system 115\n\nFigure 14.28 Geo - Stationary satellite network\n\nNow the world is converted to \"a global village\" by the orbited geo-stationary satellites using the idea presented by Sir Arther C.
